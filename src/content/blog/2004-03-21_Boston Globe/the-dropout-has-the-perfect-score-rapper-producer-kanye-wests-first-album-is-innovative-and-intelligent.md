# The `Dropout' Has the Perfect Score Rapper-Producer Kanye West's First Album Is Innovative and Intelligent

“It’s not for me to say what’s missing in hip-hop,” Kanye West says. “It’s for me to do what’s missing in hip-hop.”

Since overstatement is as common in hip-hop as recycled George Clinton hooks, it would be easy to dismiss West’s claim as coming from yet another MC with more ego than ideas. It would also be foolish because West, the hot rap and R&B producer turned rhymesmith, has backed up his words with one of the most stellar debuts in hip-hop history.

Released last month, “The College Dropout” is proof that sometimes you can believe the hype. It’s been near the top of the Billboard 200 album chart,

gone platinum, and spawned two hits, “Through the Wire” and “Slow Jamz.” It’s a marvel of production, yet it’s West’s lyrics that have both fans and critics hailing this album as one of the year’s best. Shunning most of the cliches of mainstream hip-hop, West reveals himself as smart, spiritual, insightful, and vulnerable. While many rap stars aspire to be iced-out ghetto superstars, West simply sees himself as a young man making his way in a world he’s always trying to understand better.

“I make my lyrics about stuff people go through every day in the streets,” says West, who will perform Tuesday at the Palladium in Worcester with Dilated Peoples, over the phone. “And when I say the streets, I don’t mean specifically selling drugs. I mean anybody who has to get up in the morning, get on the bus, or has to drive to work. I mean any- and everybody.”

There’s “Spaceship,” with West sympathizing with a stressed-out factory worker on a graveyard shift. “All Falls Down,” with an impassioned vocal by Syleena Johnson, bemoans those who seek confidence in material things. But don’t confuse this with a public TV documentary. Any man who can come up with the lines “She’s got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson/ Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson” (from “Slow Jamz”) has a frisky and fertile sense of humor.

Even his album’s cover is a departure. Rather than striking the obligatory pimp poses, West, dressed in a bear costume, sits alone in the bleachers of a gymnasium, looking like a dejected school mascot.

“The meaning is, I dropped out of school and took the mascot with me,” says West, 26, who left art school to pursue music. “Nothing represents a college dropout as much as a bear mascot with his head down, since mascots are usually super hyped up. I really feel like that image drives the idea of a college dropout home. It made more sense than me trying to be on the cover with a sexy look in my eyes or whatever.”

With his fresh, not to mention welcome, approach to hip-hop, West is appealing to both mainstream and underground hip-hop fans. At a recent New York show, West wore a knit sweater and a backpack (albeit a Louis Vuitton version) in a nod to so-called “backpack” rap, which is more concerned with emotions and social issues than materialism and gangsterism.

“I use all the fundamentals of backpack,” says West, a native of Chicago’s South Side. “Good stage performances, good mixdowns, a lot of musicality, and a lot of content in the lyrics.”

Andy Greenwald, a senior contributing writer at Spin, calls West’s methods and music “inspiring.”

“I appreciate that he’s trying to bridge the gap,” he says. “We’ll see if he goes so far as to put Slug [the rapper from the Minnesota-based indie rap group Atmosphere] on one of his tracks.”

Though “The College Dropout” is West’s first album as a rapper, he has been a vital presence on the hip-hop scene for years as an innovative producer. A beat scientist, West has been the rhythmic mastermind for such artists as Jay-Z (“ ’03 Bonnie & Clyde”), Alicia Keys (“You Don’t Know My Name”), Ludacris (“Stand Up”), and Britney Spears (“Me Against the Music”). Like fellow superstar producers Timbaland and the Neptunes, West has a musical fearlessness that is an integral part of his hitmaking.

“I don’t have one signature style — I have multiple signature styles,” says West, who got his break as a producer when Jermaine Dupri used one of his beats on the 1998 album “Jermaine Dupri Presents: Life in 1472.”

“It’s all about melody and message, more than anything. There’s no song I’ve ever produced that doesn’t have a melody you can catch on to, and a message.”

In “Through the Wire,” which employs a sped-up vocal from Chaka Khan’s R&B hit “Through the Fire,” West delivers a message about overcoming personal adversity. In October 2002, he survived a near- fatal car accident in Los Angeles that left him with a shattered jaw. Inspired and happy to be alive, West wrote and recorded the song - with such lines as “Thank God I ain’t too cool for the safe belt” - while his jaw was still wired shut.

“That day when I had the car accident, I made about three songs. None of those songs are being used now. I guess they’re pretty mediocre in comparison to everything else I’m doing,” West says. “On that day of the accident, those would have been the last songs you ever heard from me. So now when I go in the studio, I work on every song like it could be my last.”
