# Kanye West Delivers, His Way

## Even After False Start and Interruptions, Hip-Hop Star Gives Emotional Club Performance

Kanye West wanted everything just right Friday at the House of Blues. He stopped then restarted his performance. He cut off a verse of one of his own raps so he could do it over. He barked at the sound engineer -- "I need it louder, so I can hear it, so they can hear it" -- and cued the lighting technicians. He changed up songs on the fly and directed his 16-piece band like a conductor.

West is a star but not for the usual reasons: He has no ghetto swagger, no bling-encrusted street cred. He's not a playa or a gangsta. He's a middle-class teacher's son who was born in Atlanta, grew up on the South Side and pestered everyone from Common to Jay-Z until his talent for mixing beats was recognized.

He's coming off two multimillion-selling albums that produced not only hits but expanded the limits of how hip-hop could sound and what it could say. His rare club performance over the weekend came at a pivotal time for him and a music business that desperately needs a blockbuster hit with summer sales in the doldrums. The concert served a dual purpose: to raise funds for the rapper's youth education charity, the Kanye West foundation, and to promote his third album, "Graduation," due in stores Sept. 11.

West resonates because he tries so hard to break down the wall between what he's thinking and feeling and what the audience sees and hears. He took the oldest of hip-hop tropes and turned it into a plea that sounded almost desperate: "If you feel the way I'm feelin', won't you wave your hands," he cried during "Big Brother." The song came near the end of West's 90-minute performance, and it's not exactly a house-quaking anthem. Instead, it offered an uninhibited examination of the rapper's conflicted relationship with Jay-Z. In the song, West portrays himself as a needy, ambitious, talented-but-flawed figure who desperately craves his mentor's approval but doesn't always get it.

After an interminable opening set by a variety of West proteges, the curtain parted and the band began to perform one of West's new songs, "I Wonder." West entered to huge applause in untucked white shirt, purple cardigan, jeans and sunglasses and began to rap.

All seemed fine, except in West's mind. He cut the song short after only a minute and strode off-stage, leaving his string and horn section to sit in bewildered silence. Three minutes later, he walked on again as if nothing had happened, and performed a strident version of his 2005 hit "Diamonds From Sierra Leone," and he was off.

Older songs incited mass singalongs: "Heard 'Em Say," "Through the Wire," "All Falls Down," "Jesus Walks," "Gold Digger," "Two Words" (with guest Mos Def), "Addiction," "The New Workout Plan." More intriguing were the new songs; they showed West exploring familiar themes (resilience, perseverance) with a heavier sound, thickened with keyboards, strings and bigger beats.

The aborted "I Wonder" resurfaced later and aspired to stadium-rap heights. West even dabbled in some chords at an upright piano, but the arrangement felt under-rehearsed, not as fully realized as the recorded version.

Far better was "Stronger," which romped with a Daft Punk electro-rock sample, and "Champion," which deftly recontextualized a line from Steely Dan's "Kid Charlemagne."

West brought fierce conviction to "Can't Tell Me Nothing," backed by rumbling tympani and bass, and "Big Brother." "Good Life" was as bouyant as the title suggested. "Give me some lights, celebratory lights," West commanded. "Nothing moody."

But everything about this performance was defined by West's mood. Those wildly swinging emotions, unguarded and unfiltered, are what make him so watchable.
