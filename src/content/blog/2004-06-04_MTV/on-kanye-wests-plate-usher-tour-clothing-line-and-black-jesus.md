# On Kanye West's Plate: Usher Tour, Clothing Line and ... Black Jesus?

## Producer's Latest Jewelry Item Remixes Traditional View of Christ.

As one of the leaders of the gentleman’s fashion movement, Kanye West has kept a Polo label on his chest like Superman does with his “S.” But when West — who recently signed on to tour with Usher this summer — starts packing his bags to hit the road, he’s probably going to be taking less Ralph Lauren to make room for his own clothes.

West is launching a clothing line called Mascott, which will hit stores before the end of the year, according to West’s rep. To top (or bottom) it off, he’s also coming out with his own line of sneakers, called Mascott Trainers, which are currently in the design stage.

Also coming up are two items with a prominent religious theme. First, Kanye has finished designing the next piece in the collection of religious-themed jewelry that he’s putting out with Jacob the Jeweler. The new piece will be called Grandma’s Jesus and is the follow-up to his original Jesus piece, released in April, which is of a Caucasian Christ. Grandma’s Jesus is a depiction of Jesus as a black man.

Second is the first of his two forthcoming singles: “Jesus Walks.” The video for the song was directed by Chris Milk and is said to feature three plotlines. Also, on the remix tip, Lil Jon produced a remix of “Kanye’s Workout” featuring Luke and Farnsworth Bentley.

West is also headed back out on tour this summer, but this time he’s not hitting colleges, he’s hitting arenas as an opening act on the Usher tour, which kicks off in August. Finally, Mariah Carey has been hollering at the Chi-Town native about rustling some beats from him for her next album.
