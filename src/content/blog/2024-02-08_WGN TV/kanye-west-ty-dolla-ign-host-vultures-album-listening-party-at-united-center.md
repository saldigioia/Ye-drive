# Kanye West, Ty Dolla $Ign Host ‘Vultures’ Album Listening Party at United Center

CHICAGO — Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, and Ty Dolla $ign hosted an album listening party at the United Center on Thursday ahead of it’s release.

 “¥$,” the tandem of Ye and Ty Dolla $ign, were set to release the first volume of their upcoming album “Vultures” at midnight on Friday, but it’s still not available for fans. The pair announced the Chicago listening party on their Instagram on Tuesday.

Tickets for the “Vultures – Listening Experience” at the United Center sold out within seven minutes after going on sale on Wednesday, according to Ye.

“Vultures,” the debut single released in November, sparked controversy due to antisemitic lyrics made by Ye on record. Comments he recently tried to apologize for in December after he posted a Hebrew-language apology on his Instagram.

Ye claimed on Tuesday that he couldn’t book arena shows for the listening parties due to his previous antisemtic comments.

But, the Grammy winner then announced on his Instagram two days later that supergroup will hold a second listening party at UBS Arena in Long Island, New York on Friday following the album release.

Ye first held a listening party in Chicago for his studio album “Donda” at Solider Field in August of 2021. The larger than life event had appearances by Kim Kardashian, Marilyn Manson, DaBaby, Travis Scott, Don Toliver, Westside Gunn, and Shenseea.

Ahead of the Chicago listening party, Ye released the highly anticipated music video for the “Vultures” single, as well as the music video for “Talking/Once Again” that his daughter North West makes her musical debut on.

As fans waited patiently in lines wrapped around the United Center, doors opened at 7:45 p.m. with concertgoers slowly beginning to fill the main concourse.

An hour later, fans were starting to be let up to the 200 and 300 level of the United Center, as fog began to billow throughout the halls of the stadium.

Ty Dolla $ign and Ye, sporting a Jason Voorhees hockey mask, took the stage just after 10 p.m. when the entire United Center shook as fans cheered with excitement of their arrival.

For the next hour, the supergroup paced around to the beats of several tracks on the upcoming “Vultures” albums. Chicago fans were surprised with appearances by Bump J, YG, and North West.

The first installment of the “Vultures” album will reportedly feature artists such as Charlie Wilson, Freddie Gibbs, Quavo, Chris Brown, YG, Future, James Blake, Bump J, Lil Durk, Young Thug, Leon Bridges, Kid Cudi, and North West.
