# Culture Mulchers

At first glance, they're opposite ends of hip-hop's spectrum: Danger Mouse (left, standing), the laid-back genius who melded Jay-Z's The Black Album with the Beatles' White Album to create The Grey Album, a bootleg masterpiece that blew the term mash-up out of the water and sold exactly zero copies; and Kanye West, the Roc-A-Fella producer who went platinum as an MC on The College Dropout. We got the two together to wax wise on the state of music in 2004.

GQ: So what's on the iPod?

DM: Well, as far as rock goes, I really like PJ Harvey's record.

KW: [singing] Who the fuuuck?! I went and bought all the PJ records this year 'cause I did a show with her, and I was like, "Oh, shit!"

DM: I love that record, man. She produced it all herself.

KW: I liked that Britney Spears joint "Toxic" too.

DM: That's the joint! Those Swedish producers [Bloodshy & Avant] are really good. I was surprised when I heard it.

KW: This is going to sound mad racist or whatever, but I classify all that as "white music." Anything that wouldn'tbe played on a black radio station is classified as white music. But it's my favorite music. That's what I buy multiple copies of John Mayer, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, White Stripes. I just bought my fourth copy of the Fiona Apple album.

DM: The first or the second?

KW: The first one. [starts singing] I've never been so insulted in all my life / I could swallow the sea, wash down all this pride. … The lyrics on that!

DM: Jon Brion is all over that. You gotta see him when you'rein L.A. He plays all these instruments and loops them onstage and winds up having, like, a whole band playing, but it's just him. He can't sing great, but it's real good to watch.

GQ: Is there too much mediocrity in music right now?

KW: No! I need it so my shit sounds better.

DM: It's why the two of us, in our ways, stood out.

KW: I don't want people to start rapping like me. They gon’ fuck around and get to some of my concepts before I can!

DM: Laughs] You know, there aren't enough fans anymore; there are way more critics. Everyone feels that they can be a critic in that kind of way instead of just liking music and letting it be what it is.

KW: That's what both of us are — we're true fans who appreciate other producers and other performers. Somebody asked me, "Would you ever work with the Chili Peppers?" I said no, because I'm too much of a fan! I wouldn't wanna be worried about how loud the snare was. I wanna throw the shit on and enjoy.
