# Z100 Jingle Ball

## Madison Square Garden, New York Friday, Dec. 16

The deafening screams of tweens and teens heralded the cavalcade of Clear Channel pop icons that kicked off Christmas on Friday night at a sold-out Madison Square Garden. For the annual Z100 Jingle Ball, the station had assembled an impressive lineup of hitmakers and new acts.

Newcomers the Click Five opened with its combination of Cheap Trick hooks and Herman’s Hermits harmony in a brief set that included the chirping new single “Catch Your Wave.” The band was followed by a rousing performance from Atlanta rapper Ludacris, who put the crowd on its feet with “Stand Up.”

Fall Out Boy stormed the stage to blast through a handful of songs, notably “Sugar, We’re Going Down,” and came off like Guns N’ Roses, spinning around as if they were drunk and out of control. Especially entertaining was the abrupt way the band left the stage, with bassist Peter Wentz trashing his instrument and hurling it against the drums.

Backstreet Boys arrived to usher in the apocalypse with their grating Max Martin confections, bleating and huffing through “I Want It That Way,” which plagues elevators and food courts across the nation. Since much of their set featured songs as sickeningly sweet as the cotton candy being hawked in the venue, it’s a wonder the crowd wasn’t sent into a collective diabetic coma.

Backstreet Boys make a lot of people happy, and though they were down one member (Howie Dorough, who appeared on video to explain he was on a fundraising cruise), the remaining foursome incited riotous ovations with their every move and gesture.

The evening was further marred by what Frankie J did to Extreme’s “More Than Words,” which is illegal in 14 states. He turned a beautiful acoustic ballad into a bloated orchestral production, emptying the song of its soul. Luckily for him, New York is quite permissive, and most of the crowd wasn’t old enough to remember the 1991 original.

The indefatigable Sean Paul raised temperatures with an electrifying performance of his dancehall reggae pop. Backed by a full band and dancers in booty shorts, Paul got the crowd dancing and swaying as he blazed through a medley of about 15 of his songs, including the scorchers “We Be Burning” and “Get Busy.”

Grammy nominee Kanye West was backed by a DJ and an all-female string section and moved effortlessly through his hits, including the popular “Gold Digger.” As well-received as he was, West seemed weak in comparison to Paul.

Despite the best efforts of all, no one could touch the show-stopping excitement of Shakira. The gyrating Colombian temptress stole the show with her spellbinding beauty and sleek poprock.

Although her set was entirely too brief, she offered rock-tinged dance numbers in Spanish and English, notably “La Tortura” and the excellent, horn-driven “Hey You.”

Overall, the Jingle Ball was a fine Christmas present, though next year Z100 might consider offering fewer stocking stuffers and putting more Shakira under the tree.
