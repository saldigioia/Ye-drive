# Sound Problems Mar Otherwise Galvanizing Kanye West Show

At the end of Kanye West’s concert Monday, E Center employees were handing out free copies of West’s book, Thank You and You’re Welcome.

It’s good they weren’t handing out audio books to listen to on the way home. No one would have been able to hear it because of the ringing in our ears.

West’s “Glow in the Dark Tour,” with Rihanna, N.E.R.D. and Lupe Fiasco, was ultimately disappointing. While the stage shows and obvious energy of the performers - especially West - were a treat for the eyes, the entire show was whince-enducingly loud, while the sound coming from the stage was garbled and sludgy.

The E Center normally has no problem with acoustics and is one of the best venues to hear live music in the area. But either the arena wasn’t prepared to handle the deep bass and rhythmic beats of a hip-hop show, or the performers and their sound engineers were oblivious during the soundcheck that audience members wouldn’t be able to decipher a single word coming out of West’s mouth. (I blame the latter, judging from the E Center’s history of good-sounding shows.)

It was a shame that one of the most lyrically gifted and catchy rappers was overwhelmed by a deafening wall of sound.

West’s stage show was impressive, especially because he was the only person on the stage for the entire show - no band, no backup singers in sight. It takes incredible charisma and stage presence to avoid becoming a bore, but the way he prowled the stage, hunched over and concentrating on the emotions of the songs, was mesmerizing.

It was a high-concept show, with huge, vividly colored screens behind him and a detailed stage design that told a story about West being marooned on a deserted planet and desperate to return home in a spaceship. Between songs, he would plead with the spaceship’s female version of HAL from “2001” to take him home. Subsequent entreaties to God segued nicely into the song “Jesus Walks,” and anguish over loneliness segued (not as coherently) into “Gold Digger.”

Before the show began, it seemed as if Rihanna, an R & B songstress, would be the odd woman out in a night of rap. But she provided the musical highlight of the evening: a rousing version of “Umbrella” that closed her half-hour set, reminding the crowd what a well-crafted song it is. Because her set wasn’t overloaded with bass and instrumentation, her sound came across as the best of the night.

The other openers, rapper Lupe Fiasco and funk-rap band N.E.R.D., suffered from the same problems that West encountered. As for their highlights, Fiasco was aided by the presence of folk singer Matthew Santos, who joined him on four songs, including the chart-topping “Superstar,” and N.E.R.D. was impressive for having two drummers bring a tribal beat to their show.

But in end, you have to ask yourself a question West asks in the book that was handed out:

“Sometimes when I see a bad performance and people still clap ... I wonder if they’re clapping because they liked what they saw or because they’re happy it’s over?”
