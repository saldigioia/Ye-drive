# Kanye West Lives Up to Hype

Kanye West must feel like the king of the world.

His face is on Time Magazine, his new "Late Registration" has been one of the most anticipated records of the year, his Blackberry is undoubtedly filled with urgent requests from performers wanting his beat-making skills and, aside from 50 Cent, he is hip-hop's man of the moment.

While the hype and West's well-documented ego may seem staggering, the Chicagoan and current leading light for Roc-A-Fella Records has mostly lived up to all the noise he and the press create.

His Grammy-winning debut, "The College Dropout," featuring the single "Jesus Walks" and autobiographical "Through the Wire," was a breath of fresh air on the mainstream hip-hop landscape, where thug- life fantasies and casual misogyny still rule. His trademark sound was sped-up samples of R&B and rock songs that most folks know, providing the hooks over his stuttering, hip-shaking beats.

West may be full of himself (he is a rapper after all; it comes with the job), but he's no fool, and releasing another album filled with sped-up classic R&B hooks would have been a step backward. So, for "Late Registration" he enlisted pop producer/arranger Jon Brion (Fiona Apple, Rufus Wainwright) to add some live instrumentation and sweeping orchestral arrangements to his still-stellar beats. What they've come up with is a slightly overstuffed collection celebrating all things Kanye that will once again land him on many critics' top 10 lists.

There are plenty of well-known samples spread throughout the album's 21 tracks (which include three momentum-killing skits and a hidden track), but his taste is impeccable, incorporating Bill Withers, Etta James and Otis Redding.

Curtis Mayfield's "Move On Up" powers "Touch the Sky," an ode to his early struggles and recent meteoric success. The single "Gold Digger" is either a tongue-in-cheek look at a certain kind of woman, a true story, or a mild bit of misogynistic stereotyping, but with its sample of Ray Charles' "I Got A Woman" (and Jamie Foxx's spot- on imitation) listeners will be dancing while discussing its intent.

Guests abound, including singers Brandy and Adam Levine of Maroon 5 and rappers Cam'Ron, Nas, Paul Wall and Brandy, but they never steal the spotlight from West. Fellow Chicagoan Common turns up to add the conscious backpacker for an element on the short "My Way Home," with Gil Scott Heron's bleak "Home Is Where the Hatred Is" providing the hook. Big boss man Jay-Z provides his usual braggadocio in the "Diamonds From Sierra Leone" remix, which finds Kanye discussing blood diamonds, as opposed to the original (also here) which is unsurprisingly all about Kanye.

As a rapper, West trades witty metaphors, similes and threats touting his own badness for a regular-guy style that he uses to share details of his life and his philosophies. It works particularly well on storytelling songs, such as the heartfelt "Roses," where West manages to talk about his grandmother's illness and get in a dig at the medical industry that always seems to have a spare organ for the rich. Those serious tunes are balanced by tunes such as the sexy, throbbing pulse of the lascivious "Addiction," the sampled "la la la's" floating throughout "Hey Mama" and the humorous pat-on-his-own back "Gone."

With "Late Registration," West has easily beat the sophomore jinx and made a hip-hop album that will serve both the pop market that made him a star and the "realer-than-thou" backpackers who will grudgingly have to admit the man is talented. The backlash is inevitable, but until West's mouth writes a check his music can't cash, his reign is secure.
