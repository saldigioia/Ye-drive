# “Love Lockdown”

Kanye clearly has no business singing, and at first his monotone makes you wonder why he tried. But his vocodered flatlining complements the opening heartbeats, and when his pitch hitches up on "you lose" and "system overload," his loneliness clicks — it feels like techno-pop blues. He tells his girl he's leaving, and eventually his voice does just that. The percussion doubles into a step routine, some noise screeches through, and the heartbeat returns alone.
