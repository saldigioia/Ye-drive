# Listening, All Together, to “Watch the Throne”

On his last two albums, Kanye West has given the first words to somebody else. Nicki Minaj, the current doyenne of hip-hop, put on a British accent for the opening lines—“Twisted fiction, sick addiction, so gather ‘round children, zip it, listen”—of “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.” On “Watch the Throne,” his collaboration with Jay-Z, West is third on the mic. Frank Ocean, the crooning pseudo-member of Odd Future, starts off asking, “What’s a mob to a king? What’s a king to a god?” This serves as an invitation to Jay-Z—or Hova, as in Jay-Hova, as in Jehovah—who explains the situation in his first verse: “Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats, Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out of your seats.”

If this were, say, 2004, I would have got the hell out of my seat and to a record store on Sunday, when the album was released at midnight. “Watch the Throne” is perhaps the year’s most anticipated album: a collaboration between the biggest rapper alive, Jay-Z, now as likely to be fêted at the New York Public Library as he is in the Marcy Projects, and today’s most brash producer. (Kelefa Sanneh wrote about Jay-Z in his first piece for the magazine, and wrote about Odd Future in May.) It being 2011, I bought the album within minutes of its release, on iTunes, where it was available exclusively, a few days before it hit stores. Record shops were incensed by the special arrangement.

Coverage in the days before the release of “Watch the Throne” had focussed on just how the most anticipated album of 2011 had managed to hide from digital pirates until people actually had to pay money for it. A mixture of awe and disdain pervaded, until suddenly there it was, on top of the iTunes best-seller list, deposing Adele. Fans buzzed online in the early hours, bragging, or lamenting, that they were losing sleep to give the album a once-over—all of us hearing the songs, together, for the first time.

So, how is it? Pretty good, after two listens. It lacks the majesty of West’s last record, but Jay-Z gives the whole endeavor more forward momentum. Sasha Frere-Jones wrote of West that “he makes the most of his and his collaborators’ talents,” and he’s done that here. When the Holy Ghost is involved, you have to share the stage.
