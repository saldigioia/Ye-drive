# Rapper Took Audience to New Heights

Kanye West’s innovative “Touch The Sky” tour thrilled crowds in Hampton and stretched hip-hop.

Don’t even think about trying to sit down during a Kanye West concert.

No, really.

If you’re seated on the front row, the dapper rapper will bring his show to a grinding halt and try to have you ejected. That’s what happened at Saturday night’s otherwise spectacular concert at Hampton Coliseum.

“Y’all got to change y’all’s seats. You’re messin’ up my show!” West said after stopping the music mid-song. “There are too many people who want front-row tickets.”

West spent at least five minutes searching the crowd for a suitably enthusiastic pair of fans to replace the wallflowers. Eventually, members of his team informed him that the immobile young lady had a cast on her ankle and couldn’t stand. West apologized.

But the proudly egotistical producer, songwriter and rhyme master clearly didn’t want anyone watering down his magnificent vibe.

It was almost understandable. West’s live hip-hop extravaganza is easily as ambitious as his recordings. The “Touch the Sky” tour features a six-piece string section, a harpist and turntable wizard, as well as an innovative set design that places band members in transparent boxes that double as video screens.

Songs from his new disc, “Late Registration,” are interwoven with tunes from his Grammy-winning 2004 album, “The College Dropout,” to create a loose narrative about overcoming life’s inevitable obstacles.

Even though the rapper’s 90-minute set bunched hits at the tail end, the star’s charisma and energy kept the night’s music cohesive and engaging. Eighteen concerts into the tour, the wild West show is obviously hitting its stride.

On stage, West shadowboxed, sprinted and writhed — acting out the messages delivered in his rhymes.

Decked out in a gray blazer, pink dress shirt and sunglasses, he spat “I got to testify, come up in the spot lookin’ extra fly,” on the show-opening “Touch the Sky.” Before “Drive Slow,” Kanye was wheeled onto the stage in bed. Pretending he was waking up, he rolled out of the sack and fiddled with his clock radio before saying, “I’m already late for work. Gas is expensive as hell. I think I’m gonna drive as slow as possible.”

Other highlights included “Gone,” a new song in which the string section created an eerie mood; “Roses,” a harrowing account of visiting his dying grandmother in the hospital; and the smash “Jesus Walks,” which presented West dressed in ivory-colored threads and drenched by white light, surrounded by billowing smoke.

For “Bring Me Down,” West stood with his back to the audience as quotes from bad reviews scrolled past on a giant video screen.

It was a striking image. But with a pair of hit albums, tons of critical acclaim and fan adulation, why does West feel persecuted?

For someone who describes himself as “the superman of self- esteem,” West seems to have a remarkably thin skin.
