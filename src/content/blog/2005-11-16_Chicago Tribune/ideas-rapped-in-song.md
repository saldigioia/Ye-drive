# Ideas Rapped in Song

It was a telling sign that when Kanye West used a bed as a prop during his concert Monday at the UIC Pavilion, it wasn’t to simulate a close encounter with a scantily clad dancer or a provocatively dressed fan.

Rap and R&B smoothies have been known to titillate their audiences with risque play-acting in their concerts, but as with much of his career so far, West is more interested in busting hip-hop cliches than exploiting them.

So West woke up in his bed alone, and then groggily faced another day working at a retail store in the songs “Drive Slow” and “Spaceship.” Later, he was kneeling next to the bed praying for his ailing grandmother in “Roses.”

These were images to which just about anyone in West’s middle-class audience could relate. The 28-year-old rapper in the preppy clothes paced the stage in a gangsta-free zone, where guns, gang signs and oversize displays of bling were passe. Instead, he offered lyrical, sometimes comical slices from a life growing up on the South Side, working dead-end jobs in shopping malls while trying to establish himself as a hip-hop producer. His unthreatening image has made him one of the few rap acts to appeal to a wide audience outside hip-hop’s core. Three Grammys, two multimillion-selling albums and one Time magazine cover story hailing him as “the smartest man in pop music” have helped make him a major star, albeit an outspoken one. In recent weeks, he’s criticized President Bush on New Orleans hurricane relief, and campaigned for greater tolerance of gays in hip-hop. He may be mainstream, but he’s not milquetoast.

On stage, West floated Godzilla-size pop hooks built on crowd-pleasing pop references: An opening burst of the theme from “The Jeffersons;” a Ray Charles vocal for “Gold Digger;” a nod to Shirley Bassey and the James Bond movie soundtracks in “Diamonds from Sierra Leone.” The ear candy may have been strictly middle of the road, but it provided an entree to more complex ideas. Beneath the exultant chorus of “Jesus Walks,” a lapsed Christian wrestles with his faith. Tucked inside the anthemic hook of “Diamonds,” the rapper questions the human toll exacted in African mines to satisfy his jewel craving. And the bedside sentiments of “Roses” also served as a critique of a health-care system that neglects the poor.

Sonically, this was a hip-hop tour that distanced itself from the sturdy two-turntables-and-a-microphone aesthetic with a seven-member string section, as well as a keyboardist, a percussionist, two back-up singers and a deejay.

The band was arrayed in four transparent cubes, which doubled as video screens, an avant-garde presentation worthy of David Bowie. The visuals—a blend of dramatic blood-run lighting, vivid black-and-white images, religious iconography and even excerpts from negative reviews—were as disturbing as they were alluring. They enhanced the harsh beats of “Crack Music” and the dissonant outro of “Gone.”

On several levels, West’s concert was unlike any hip-hop tour ever staged. It moved from peak to peak fueled by the expert integration of music, message and visuals, while dispensing with right side-left side, wave-your-hands-in-the-air cliches. For years West has been primarily known as a producer, but he prowled the lip of the stage in his sports coats and slacks like a seasoned showman.

Oddly, the only break in the action came when West invited his old South Side mentor and role model, Common, to join him for a mid-concert mini-set. Though the shaven-headed guest was at his fiery best on “Testify” and “The Light,” the added star power killed some of the momentum West had already built. The curtain closed on the band, the lights went up, and the effect was more like a commercial interruption than a seamless extension of West’s vision. This was a show conceived like a multi-act play, and hip-hop’s most ambitious entertainer needed no help in bringing it down the home stretch.
