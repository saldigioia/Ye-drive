# Grammy Good Time

HOLLYWOOD -- This year's post-Grammy party lap widened with a new stop on the map: Good Music's bash, hosted by Kanye West, John Legend and Common.

Fete, held at the Lot Studios in West Hollywood, was a welcome special on the post-kudos menu, which also boasted soirees from Sony-BMG, EMI, Universal, Warner Music Group, the Recording Academy and the William Morris Agency.

In fact, so many opted for the new fare that the party was periodically shut down by the fire marshal. At one point, guests stampeded the metal detectors, prompting security guards to slide soundstage doors shut and refuse entry for an hour. By 10:80 p.m., the high security soiree baited more than 1,000 partiers and lured the LAPD to add bonus defense. Despite chaos outside, the scene was themed "Heaven" inside, featuring all-white decor, a giant replica of West's trademark teddy bear and girls clad in Victoria's secret-style angel garb.

Execs and artists soaked up old-Hollywood vibes at Sony-BMG's bash at the poolside Tropicana Bar. Those slightly less connected schmoozed in the only slightly less exclusive Library Bar upstairs in the Roosevelt Hotel.

Meanwhile, the EMI gig at Paramount was surprisingly mellow for a label. Guests hobnobbed on stage 16 as DJ AM spun from the back of a Cadillac Escalade parked on the raised dance floor.

Over at the WMA gathering, held at a private home in the Hollywood Hills, the most sought after ticket was a pen, according to one partygoer. With a guest list of more that 2,000, industry execs and talent were out to exchange numbers. Even Jim Wiatt was impressed by the turnout. "With this many people, it's a good place to make friends," he said.

Rounding out the evening was the WMG fete at the Pacific Design Center and Universal's party at the downtown Palm.
