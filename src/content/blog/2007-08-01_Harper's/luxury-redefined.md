## Kanye West & Alexis Phifer

### At His Pop-Chic Home in Los Angeles, the Rap Star Explains How His Designer Fiancée Influences His Famously Fierce Style

West and Phifer’s house comes alive with Takashi Murakami pillows and a 1970s Maurice Calka Boomerang desk topped with Kaws robots. On Phifer: Gucci gown with belt, $3,995. 800-234-8224. On West: Louis Vuitton jacket. Dior Homme shirt. Jil Sander pants, West’s own.

When Kanye West is asked to describe his style, he pauses for a second — but only a second. “It’s like ... pop luxe. Pop and luxury. Everything about me is pop and luxury.”

In West’s three-tier modern house at the foot of the Hollywood Hills, luxury is the first thing you see. A pile of Louis Vuitton trunks greets guests inside the foyer; a waist-high neon-green Marc Newson Dom Pérignon bottle sits in his office. Lush cashmere drapes line the windows overlooking Hollywood Boulevard. And a Crestron system allows West to control — Bill Gates-style — the house’s climate, lighting, and music from any computer in the world.

Yet despite the obvious luxe, the home hardly feels like the pimped-out pad one might expect from a multiplatinum-selling rapper. Maybe it’s because West, 30, prides himself on being more than that, or maybe it has something to do with his fiancée, fashion designer Alexis Phifer.

Phifer, also 30 — who is sporting a square diamond engagement ring so big, it could pass for a bubblegum bauble — fits perfectly into Kanye’s love of luxury and fun: Today she’s wearing J Brand jeans, a vintage red ROCK AND ROLL T-shirt, a Dries Van Noten clear plastic belt, and old-school high-top white Reeboks. She dresses casually at her downtown design studio, she says, but can’t help herself when it comes to accessories: “Even when I go to work, I have a nice handbag. My favorites are the woven leather Bottega Veneta ones.”

The day the couple met, in 2002, fashion was already factoring into their relationship. “Alexis was wearing Miss Sixties,” recalls West, who was then a hit-making record producer. “I had on this throwback jersey, and the first thing I said to her, because I could tell she was stylish, was ‘I don’t normally dress like this!’”

Phifer’s closet is full of both current designers (Stella McCartney, Olivier Theyskens, Christopher Kane, and Rachel Roy) and vintage dresses and jewelry (Lanvin and Chanel) that she snatches up from the West Hollywood store Coquette. Her most cherished item? “A vintage Lucite cuff that looks like candy with this hot-pink stone in it, like a diamond. I can’t get enough of Lucite.” Phifer also wears dresses from her own collection, Ghita, which she says means “special jewel, gem of the sea.” The short, flirty styles are made, she says, “for the confident woman who doesn’t mind showing a little of her sexuality.”

Phifer’s other half is currently wearing a black Prada ski cap, jeans, and a colorful silk jacket that resembles a stained-glass window. “It’s Pastelle,” West says, describing the fashion line he has been developing for three years. His favorite designers are Dries Van Noten and Martin Margiela, he says, adding, “I lived for Dior until Hedi Slimane left. So I’m gonna see what he comes out with next.”

West’s closets take up almost one full floor of his home, a tall rectangular box updated by interior designer Don Stewart to resemble the work of minimalist Italian architect Claudio Silvestrin. The top floor is adorned with unique pieces, including a 17th-century suit of samurai armor he picked up in Rome. And on the dining-room ceiling, what looks like an ode to the Sistine Chapel: a painting of West flying among angels by artist Ernie Barnes. “I asked for angels, and he put me in there,” West explains a bit bashfully. This from the man who stormed the stage at last year’s MTV Europe Music Awards insisting his video should have won? “I’m really shy,” he maintains. “Why do you think I’m so cocky? It overcomes it.”

Mirroring the two sides of his personality is the juxtaposition of interior styles. Blending in with the antiques are surprising spots of modern color: a Fernando and Humberto Campana chair made of stuffed tigers, whales, and dogs (squeeze some and they bark); playful Japanese toy figurines; colorful Takashi Murakami flower pillows; and a human-size Buzz Lightyear: “That’s from — da-da-da-daaaaa! — Japan,” West says in the trademark Buzz holler.

This month, West will release his latest album, Graduation, while Phifer plans to debut Ghita at New York Fashion Week in September. There will also, in the future, be a wedding. Phifer is leaving the dress “to the big dogs — Olivier Theyskens or Valentino,” she explains. “I want something a little more dramatic, more body conscious. I don’t want a big prom dress.”

Like a match made in fashion heaven, the smitten West is the first to give Phifer credit for his sharp look. “Alexis was my original stylist,” he says with a grin. “She helped me get fresh!”
