# It's North West's World, We All Just Live in It

## For Her First Ever Solo Magazine Cover, the Most Talked-About 10-Year-Old Chats Style, Basketball and Being 'The Best Ever'.

In a climate that venerates celebrity and configures fame as power, North West is the inheritor of a complicated crown. The child of a generation’s two most famous figures, she has been in the spotlight since birth, and grown up in front of a constantly rolling camera. But who is the princess of pop culture? In the words of a ten-year-old who has the world at her feet: “The Best Ever.”

**What’s your favourite song right now?**

“Through the Wire” by Kanye West.

**Do you like singing? Do you like performing?**

Yeah, I like singing. Performing is my favourite.

**Do you think you get that from your family?**

Sometimes, mostly from me though. And then a little bit of my dad.

**What’s your favourite outfit right now?**

Vintage T-shirts and Spider sweats.

**What item of clothing would you like to have that you don’t have yet?**

My mom’s clothes and my dad’s clothes, if they fit me.

**Who’s your style icon?**

Me.

**What’s your favourite thing from this shoot?**

That I got fries, because I really craved fries, and I love doing hair and I got to do my own edges for this shoot.

**Do you like having your picture taken?**

Yes. Only when I want to, because ehhh, I don’t want to sometimes. But not by the paparazzi.

**What’s the best thing in your wardrobe?**

My Michael Jackson jacket that my mom got me for Christmas!

**What’s the best fashion show you’ve ever been to?**

My little sister’s fashion show in her closet.

**If you were an animal what would you be?**

I want to be a mosquito. Because I’m allergic to them and I can tell them all to leave me alone.

**What three words would you use to describe yourself?**

Umm... The Best Ever.

**What’s the best thing about being North West?**

I get to play basketball. Everything. I got to go to Halloween Horror Nights.

**If you could meet any person who would it be?**

Tupac.

**What do you like to paint?**

Everything, except helicopters. Helicopters are so hard because they have all these little lines.

**Have you made any more art recently?**

Yeah, literally today in art class. But it’s a secret for my mom’s birthday. Last week I finished a landscape and a sunset and I made a little circle thing.

**Do you have any other hobbies?**

Yes. Going shopping for people. Basketball, but it’s not a hobby, it’s a lifestyle. And I just love basketball so much.

**What is your favourite memory?**

When I first tried basketball, because I was so bad. So I know those memories and I’m like, ‘Ooh, now I’m so good’, I got so much better.

**Where would you like to live if you didn’t live in LA?**

Japan.

Describe your life in three words...

Blessed, awesome, cool.

**What do you want to be when you’re older?**

A basketball player, a rapper, um... Well, when I was seven, I wanted to be a boxer. But now I don’t want to be a boxer. I’m going to do art on the side. When I’m, like, thirteen, I want to walk dogs, to make money to buy art supplies, because everything around here is so expensive. So a rapper, a basketball player, and I’m going to make artwork that I sell. Also, one day I want to own Yeezy and SKIMS, and I want to be a business owner.
