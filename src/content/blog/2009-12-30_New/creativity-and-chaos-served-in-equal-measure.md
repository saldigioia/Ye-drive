# Creativity and Chaos, Served in Equal Measure

2009-12-30

Just before Christmas, Kanye West interrupted a Los Angeles show by his protégé Kid Cudi to share some feelings with the crowd.

“This is my first time back in America for the past, like, three, four months,” he said. Since his pillorying for divebombing Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech at the MTV Video Music Awards in September, he’d been uncharacteristically mute, head tucked underneath shell, waiting for the darts to stop.

“I love the game so much,” he went on, “and I’m so passionate about it, that I just can’t take” the stress. Then he started rapping, a new, unreleased verse: “I’m so anxious, I’m getting anxiety/Begging one of these ... fashion houses to hire me,” he began (again, with some colorful language strewn in), then continued:

> I said, if you acquire me

> I could be a quiet me

> Call it verbal dieting

> Give me your herbal chai tea

> With that, Mr. West, promised, “I’ll be calm.”

As if. Mr. West’s resistance to stasis has been his one constant in the last decade, which has taken him from behind-the-scenes Chicago rap-purist producer to perma-spotlighted global pop dynamo. Of celebrities in any milieu, he’s the least predictable without sacrificing his art. Instability is his diesel.

And in a decade marked by perpetual apprehension and irrational exuberance, he was the most musically inventive, the most psychologically complicated, and the most emblematic of the times: an exemplar of creativity through, and about, chaos.

He began the decade as a nobody, but even after 10 million albums sold Mr. West is nowhere near comfortable. His hubris may be overwhelming at times, but it’s undercut by his self-conception as an underdog. It makes perverse sense that his final creative act of the decade would be to grouse about his struggles in making an entrée into the fashion world. When has he ever been content?

For a rapper such insecurity is still odd turf, even after several years of Mr. West mining it, and even after he spawned a second wave of second guessers like Kid Cudi and Drake.

But Mr. West is still uncertain of his place in the world. Maybe it’s a fear of impermanence, or a persistent mistrust of the wisdom of others, but no one advertises for himself quite like Mr. West. He got a list of his early hit productions tattooed on his forearm, presumably in case anyone forgot about them. And every time he was nominated for an award and didn’t win, he griped, loudly. (The most significant reminder of the meaninglessness of awards ceremonies is Mr. West’s insistence on their importance.)

These moments were blasts of arrogance, sure, but also showed the raw pain of rejection laid bare. In an era where micro-confession became the main form of communication, and where masquerade was rewarded with scrutiny and dismantling, Mr. West helped set the tone. Important moments and insignificant ones tend to have the same value in his world. His mother dies, he assaults a paparazzo, President Obama calls him “a jackass”: it’s all just more data for the live stream.

In this way he was the most consistent artist of the decade, a beloved superstar whose worst enemy was a complete lack of superego. He existed completely in the moment, stubbornly ready to risk status for the evanescent thrill of truth telling.

Often it came off as trying too hard. Mr. West sports his taste, or his attempts at taste, conspicuously. For his second album, Mr. West imported Jon Brion, invigorator of contemplative troubadours, to be as much collaborator as passport stamp. He worked with Larry Charles on a never-launched TV show. He made a gruesome, fantastical short film with Spike Jonze. He released signature sneaker lines with Nike and Louis Vuitton. He wore Rick Owens, and bragged about it.

His blog posts — not just the ones he wrote himself, IN ALL CAPS, which were gloriously untethered notes from the adrenaline stream, but even the ones posted by his minions — have collectively cultivated a modern aesthetic: contemporary furniture, Japanese design, Belgian fashion, models with glutes for days. It’s a one-stop shop of progressive masculinity, a worldview accumulated through links.

But Mr. West could still transcend even his own self-consciousness, achieving something sublime. His “Glow In the Dark” tour was extravagant and captivating (if sometimes misguided), Mr. West pitching himself alternately as a fearless explorer and a lost space boy. He dressed as Jesus for the cover of Rolling Stone, thorns and all. After Hurricane Katrina, he went on national television and proclaimed, “George Bush doesn’t care about black people.” The shivers in his voice and body weren’t reflections of his doubts on the matter, but of knowing he was inviting a hailstorm of criticism — and knowing he had no choice.

Amid all this it’s tough to remember that Mr. West still has challenges before him. Some of the awards he lost, he should have won. He didn’t make SoundScan’s list of the decade’s Top 50 album sellers, meaning that his influence, while great, has bounds.

Even if it’s going unnoticed, Mr. West is improving, as a producer, a songwriter and as a rapper too. Apart from Lil Wayne he’s grown more than anyone in the genre, still rapping like the next rhyme might get him the record deal that saves him from a life of Midwestern mediocrity. That angst was there on his verse on Jay-Z’s “Run This Town,” one of this year’s best by any M.C. First came the lecture on fame’s perils, quickly followed by an acknowledgement of his complicity:

> Police escorts, everybody passports

> 

> This the life that everybody ask for

> 

> This a fast life, we are on a crash course

> 

> What you think I rap for, to push a ... RAV4?

But at the end of the verse, he peels back the curtain to show himself gasping for air, no reprieve in sight. It’s part boast, part cry for help: “You feeling like you’re running, huh?/Now you know how we feel.”
