# Kanye West Injured in L.A. Accident

## Roc Producer Hospitalized; Manager Says Jaw Was Fractured.

Roc-A-Fella artist Kanye West is in a Los Angeles hospital recovering from injuries sustained in a car accident.

West, who has gained fame producing for such rhyme all-stars as Jay-Z, Scarface and Mos Def, was injured shortly after leaving a recording studio at about 3 a.m. Wednesday morning (October 23). Details about his condition were not released by the hospital.

Manager Gee Roberson said that West’s life is not in danger, and that he is in stable condition with a fractured jaw. West is expected to be released from the hospital within the next few days, and his jaw will be wired shut for the next six weeks.

While the LAPD could not disclose any details, sources close to West said he was in L.A. working on music for State Property’s Beanie Sigel and Peedi Crakk, and after the studio session, West crashed his rented vehicle near the W Hotel in West Hollywood, where he was staying. No other people were involved in the incident, the sources said.

West’s signing to Roc-A-Fella was officially announced two weeks ago in New York and his debut is expected sometime next year. In the meantime, his rhymes and beats will be heard on the upcoming double album and soundtrack to “Paid in Full” and Jay-Z’s The Blueprint 2: The Gift and the Curse, both due next month.
