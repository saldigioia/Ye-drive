# Kanye West at Governors Ball

"Honestly, when I listen to radio, that ain't where I wanna be no more," said Kanye West during a brief-but-potent bit of banter in the middle of his Governors Ball set last night, talking about his unconventional, radio-single-free marketing strategy leading up to his new album Yeezus. "At this point, I could give a fuck about selling a million records, as long as I put out an album that you can rock to all motherfucking summer." And based on the five new tracks played last night — "New Slaves", "Black Skinhead", and three others — it's probably good that he doesn't have his sights set on multi-platinum status this time, because Yeezus is shaping up to be his most outré album yet. The previously unheard songs were all about desperation, ice-pick synths, and convulsing drums, something like a hyperkinetic version of 808s & Heartbreak's relatively dour robo-paranoia.

They punctuated a set that was heavy on Kanye's darkest and most serious hits: "Power", "Heartless", "Jesus Walks", "Can't Tell Me Nothing", "Say You Will". Even the night's three sing-along moments did not center around your typical "all together now!" fodder, instead touching on thoughts of suicide ("Power"), betrayal ("Heartless"), and hopeless douchebaggery ("Runaway"). Things got a little lighter for "Good Life" — but then West cut the song off short, admitting he had forgotten a verse. Generally, though, his focus was as vivid as the orange-and-blue fighter jets that often backed him on huge screens.

Speaking of those Jumbotrons, when they did show West performing, he was presented as a set of ghostly trails that built up on top of each other. At one point during the 100-minute set, the tripped-out filters fell away to show him crisply— but he quickly noticed the change and requested "a new look." The trails returned, breaking up his image once again.
