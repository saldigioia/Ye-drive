# Kardashians Say Kanye West 'Blessed' Dash New York Store

## â€˜He's Our Fashion Muse,' Khloe Says of the Rapper at Their Opening in Soho.

When photos emerged of Kanye West hanging out with Kim Kardashian while she was shooting her latest reality show venture in New York City, it led many people to speculate that the pair was perhaps romantically entangled. But the Kardashian sisters themselves clarified to MTV News that West's involvement in their lives is really more about the fashion than it is about matters of the heart.

"He's our fashion muse ... nothing happens in fashion unless Kanye blesses it," Khloe dished at the New York opening of Dash on Wednesday night, where Kanye was also in attendance. "He blessed Dash New York, and look at the turnout."

Kim added, "He came to check out the store, tell us what he thinks, and he had to come to the opening."

Kourtney recalled the first time they hung out with 'Ye at their New York fashion outpost. "He was here actually on our first day that we came to Dash New York," Kourtney further recalled. "And then he was like, 'You're opening in three weeks?' He was shocked."

Having Kanye on hand was just part of why the night was truly a dream come true. "We are so excited," Kim said. "I mean, fashion is our life. It's been a dream of ours to open up a store in New York City."

"And honestly, it's a miracle that this store opened," Kourtney continued. "We have been working so hard every day since Kim and I got to New York. Khloe's been here at the store all day long, slaving away."

While all the girls have been working hard to get the store opened, Khloe may have exaggerated how much harder she worked. "I've been scrubbing the floors on my hands and knees," she joked. "Kourtney went to music class today, and Kimberly was in hair and makeup for 22 hours, so it's funny that the store came together all of a sudden."

The New York TV series will focus on Kim and Kourtney, but Khloe has no hard feelings about being left out of it. "Kourtney and I did the Miami show together," she said. "So, it was actually a good thing to see them bond together, and they're both on similar pages right now. I'm married, and I love, love being at home."
