# Mark Ronson

## Guest Editor Kanye West Builds With the Only Rich-Kid DJ-Turned-Producer Worth a Damn.

As the stepson of Foreigner guitarist Mick Jones, Mark Ronson didn’t have to do anything to be famous. But unlike some other douche-bag celebrity seeds that pollute our world, he refuses to coast on his parentals’ credentials. The 32-year-old DJ, producer, and co-founder of Allido Records continues to make his own mark with his second album, Version, and production work for Amy Winehouse, Lily Allen, and Christina Aguilera. So Kanye — Ronson’s friend from the old Roc-A-Fella days — catches up with him for yet another accomplishment: cramming two stars into a one-page interview.

**KANYE WEST:** What’s up, Mark? How’s your year been?

**MARK RONSON:** It depends. If you go by the Jewish calendar, my year is shit, but since January it’s been all right.

**WEST:** When does the Jewish calendar start?

**RONSON:** It’s about September, which is when I went to rehab. He kids. Ronson merely produced Amy Winehouse’s hit “Rehab.”] How are you doing? Congratulations on your engagement.

**WEST:** Thank you. You know, I look up to you in a way. I would much rather have my kid come out like Mark Ronson than a lot of the rich kids I’ve met in L.A. Their parents are great figures in pop culture, and the kids are so fucking lame.

**RONSON:** Yeah, I think that comes somewhat from a straight English upbringing. Even a total spoiled brat dickhead will still open the door for you.

**WEST:** I want my kid to be raised where they have to get on the train-it’s not just Rodeo Drive every day.

**RONSON:** I kind of hate L.A. for that shit. People go out to L.A. and just lose the point. I’m also a little bit burnt out on rap music, to tell you the truth.

**WEST:** Most people hate rap music right now. It’s in the hair-band phase.

**RONSON:** It’s like disco. All the records sound like instructional dance songs-lean back, rock with it. It becomes [Jane] Fonda-esque. When people have to be told what to do to have a good time, that’s when I think music’s sort of lost.

**WEST:** Yeah, you’re in that moment now. You just have to accept it.

**RONSON:** I first got really into hip-hop in that classic Def Jam era. Except for the Beastie Boys, it was all pretty edgy. That’s something that I miss in this era of hip-hop. Everybody seems to be in this shallow disco bubble, like half the world might not as well be going on.

**WEST:** Another thing that’s funny about rap, rappers do an interview and say, “I got something for everybody.”

**RONSON:** When you hear that, you know the album has nothing for anybody.

**WEST:** I hate that concept. Even “Slow Jamz,” which (girls] love, l’m like, “I’ma play this Vandross / You gon’ take your pants off.”

**RONSON:** Yeah, you’re a misogynist asshole. I always meant to tell you that.

**WEST:** But because I got a Polo on, I get away with it. Where do designers get inspiration from now that it’s not really cool to dress hip-hop anymore? I ask that being the dude that gets bashed the most for having pants that fit nicely.

**RONSON:** Remember when Versace put bicycle locks on runway models like five years after Treach did it? Fashion people, they’re late on everything. I think it’s kind of cool that there’s this key group of kids that are coming out now that are dressing like EPMD.

**WEST:** The high-top Flights and shit.

**RONSON:** A tight jean jacket and giant glasses. I’m actually glad to see hip-hop fashion head back to that. It’s just like anything that’s been around for 10 years and doesn’t look cutting-edge anymore.

**WEST:** I respect Marilyn Manson because of how far he takes it. He is the last true rock star.

**RONSON:** People don’t want to believe that their pop stars are the guys next door. There’s a reason that people look up to Alice Cooper, David Bowie, and Jimi Hendrix-you knew that you didn’t have the balls to be like that.

**WEST:** I read some shit, some excerpts from Amy [Winehouse]. She was dissing people, like just coming down on any celebrity possible.

**RONSON:** Amy’s smart and funny. She’s English when she insults somebody.

**WEST:** Do all those things go together-smart, funny, English?

**RONSON:** I don’t know. She said Dido’s the soundtrack to death. I think Dido’s a really nice person, but that’s funny. If she insulted me in that way, I would laugh. Maybe it’s just easier to take coming out of a pretty mouth...

**WEST:** Women can say anything they fucking want.

**RONSON:** It’s refreshing, so I started to turn up the honesty in these English interviews I’ve been doing. I said something about Joss Stone and I saw it back in print, and I look like such a dick. Whether I think her liner notes are ridiculous or not, it’s not really my place to say it.

**WEST:** I don’t want to come down on her, she’s doing her thing, but when I saw her first video it was very much inspiration for me to make something that looked nothing like it.

**RONSON:** Oh God, I made this girl’s life worse. Again.

**WEST:** I’m not trying to bash Joss Stone. Sometimes artists need a little direction.

**RONSON:** On my first record [“Ooh Wee”], Sylvia Rhone was like, “We’re going to make a video in a club and you’re going to be DJing, going wiggy-wiggy, and then we’ll have Ghostface and Nate Dogg and it’ll be cool.”

**WEST:** The video didn’t capture what I think of Mark Ronson.

**RONSON:** No, it was a cheesy video, and I just went along, like, “You guys know better than me!” And that was completely wrong. e
