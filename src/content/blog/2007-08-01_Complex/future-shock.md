# Future Shock

I’m not trying to be overly poetic, but there’s something about Kanye West that puts him on a different plane than almost everyone else making contemporary music. In a day and age where culture and politics are constantly shifting, there remains an immovable truth about him. That is to say, there’s something really sincere about his effort, despite — or perhaps because of — the paradoxes that he’s bundled up in. He blurs the lines between aesthetic and content, confidence and insecurity, and the whole time you never really know if it’s planned or if it was effortless. And at the end of the day it doesn’t matter; the fact that you even question it is testament to the deftness of his skill.

As Kanye enters his thirties and releases his third full-length album, Graduation, his place next to all the great musicians of our time becomes more and more certain. His throwback ethos (without relying on the crutch of nostalgia) and attention to detail make him arguably the most meticulous musician active today. Combine that with his laborious attention to style and you can see that he’s nothing less than a modern (or perhaps post-modern) performance artist. I got a chance to sit down and discuss all of the above with the man of the hour, to get his take on the finer things in life: culture, politics, and, well, porn. Enjoy.

**MARC ECKO:** So, this is the first time I’ve ever interviewed anyone. I’m a little nervous. I’ve had some whiskey.

**KANYE WEST:** OK, great. [Laughs.] I’m honored.

**MARC ECKO:** I was curious, who was more of an influence on your style, your father or your grandfather?

**KANYE WEST:** Definitely my grandfather on my mother’s side. He was just sharp like that.

**MARC ECKO:** Do you think you’re nostalgic for that look, generationally? Was he more dapper?

**KANYE WEST:** Well, yeah, he was dapper — I don’t want to diss my dad’s style, but my dad would wear some JCPenney’s khakis and stuff. He wasn’t really into style like that. I remember one summer, when high-top fades was out, I was like 13 years old, and he told me, “OK, you can get your hair cut once a month.” Which means that an Afro would start growing on the side of my head, so I had like a high-top fade and a high-top side.

**MARC ECKO:** [Laughs.]

**KANYE WEST:** And I remember I started crying, and he was like, “Yo, why you crying? I didn’t know your hair meant that much to you.”

**MARC ECKO:** When you were growing up in Chicago in those early adolescent years, who’d you look to as an aesthetic role model?

**KANYE WEST:** Well, I always was really into clothes and stuff like that. And they used to have a store called Merry-Go-Round in the mall and it was that store I wanted to go to and just stare at stuff. It was all that In Living Color–era stuff with the baggy Hammer slacks and the — 

**MARC ECKO:** You were rocking Hammer slacks?

**KANYE WEST:** Yeah, I actually wore some Hammer slacks.

**MARC ECKO:** See, I had you for polka dots…

**KANYE WEST:** Oh yeah, I had both. So, uh, not my finest moment. But, I wore that to school — and this is back in grammar school. It’s like people wore that in videos, but people would never actually really wear that in real life. And that’s when I figured out that I didn’t really dress how people dressed in “real life.” I was like on TV before I was on TV.

And that’s when I figured out that I didn’t really dress how people dressed in “real life.” I was like on TV before I was on TV.

**MARC ECKO:** When you visit family, do you dress more modestly?

**KANYE WEST:** People say you’re supposed to dress for the occasion. What I always say is dress like you’re coming from somewhere and you got someplace to go. You’ll probably be a little bit more yourself. That’s the attitude I had walking into Bassline studios in Italian shoes. I wasn’t dressing like I was supposed to stay in Bassline, you know what I’m sayin’?

**MARC ECKO:** Talk to me about your clothing line, Pastelle. We’ve had countless conversations about it, you’ve talked about your aspiration to get in this industry and be taken seriously. What’s going on with Pastelle today, why is it taking so long?

**KANYE WEST:** Just getting the right designs. It’s a gift and a curse. You’ve got all eyes on you, so if you deliver something great, it’s gonna get held as, “Oh, it’s supposed to be great.” And even if it’s good or it’s OK or something, it’s gonna get bashed. There were phases where I could just do the bear on a Polo and it would’ve made $100 million. At a certain point. But I always say I was a designer before I was a rapper, and I really wanted to get into design. So then, trying to start designing and goin’ with my girl down to the fashion

district and stuff, and looking at fabrics and stuff like that, I’m like, “Oh, shit. This is real.” I’ve learned so much about materials and fabrics and applications and sequence and shiny fabrics and fits and all type of shit.

**MARC ECKO:** So when are you gonna do it? You didn’t answer my question.

**KANYE WEST:** Yeah, we’ll have stuff in stores by November.

**MARC ECKO:** OK, good for you.

**KANYE WEST:** You and I both know that I’ve had deals on the table. I was gonna put something in someone’s hands, but just with my music, with my videos, and anything I do, that’s like jail, for someone else to be able to push the button on you. Nothing beats the freedom of saying, “No, I don’t want to do that. Yes, I do want to do this.”

**MARC ECKO:** What in your life made you such a fucking micromanager? I’m not dissing you for that. I mean, Stanley Kubrick was a micromanager. But for sure, it’s a golden handcuffs for you. Is it from a position of fear? Is it a position of confidence? Where is it coming from?

**KANYE WEST:** Yeah, that’s a stumper. I don’t know where, what exactly made me…well, my father was very much like that. I don’t want to use the word “anal,” but that’s what you have to be. Like, micromanager is a very nice way to say anal-retentive. Any project that he started doing, he would get so focused on it.

**MARC ECKO:** Would it drive you crazy? Did it affect your relationship?

**KANYE WEST:** Well, no, because I was a little kid and all I could do was learn from it. So I got a lot of that focus from my dad, and the aspiration to be an entrepreneur or do something creative, do something that his neighbor wasn’t doing.

**MARC ECKO:** Our entire lives, white folks have copied black trends, from fashion to music. And now we’re in this moment where it seems like things have flipped, with black kids dressing like hipsters and bikers. What happened and where is it going?

**KANYE WEST:** Style just keeps changing, and that’s what it is right now. What is the true take on hipster? Why do hipsters like the most gangsterest of the gangster rap music? What is the reason behind that? I think it’s a little racist. But it’s equally as racist as why we like the movie White Chicks.

**MARC ECKO:** Speaking of white chicks, what is it with you and porn? Page Six had it that you had some bag with interracial porn. Is black-on-blond really the thing? And why don’t you just get down like me and just order it in a hotel?

**KANYE WEST:** Because you can’t, um — 

**MARC ECKO:** Just for the record, all of my porno is all straight black.

**KANYE WEST:** OK, and it should be, I mix it up. [Laughs.]

**MARC ECKO:** [Laughs.]

**KANYE WEST:** Straight black.

**MARC ECKO:** Like Big Booty 3.

**KANYE WEST:** Because that’s what you need. You need a little ignorance on the porn — 

**MARC ECKO:** What’s up, why were you carrying these videos? You’re a superstar, just fuckin’ $19.99 that shit at the hotel on Pay-Per-View.

**KANYE WEST:** Because you can’t fast-forward, you can’t have it when you want it and shit like that.

**MARC ECKO:** Put it on your laptop. Have your intern make a Quicktime file. That’s what I do. And I have it deep within some really dark folder on the computer that my wife would never find. You know, like, “pp444322,” deep within Photoshop.

**KANYE WEST:** Yeah, I do that, too. But I appreciate the experience of going to purchase it.

**MARC ECKO:** When you lost your virginity, was there music playing in the room? Or on the Ferris wheel or wherever you lost your virginity?

**KANYE WEST:** It was in my room and I make music in my room, but — 

**MARC ECKO:** That might explain your micromanagement. Did you lose your virginity listening to your own beats? [Laughs.]

**KANYE WEST:** Nah, nah, I didn’t.

**MARC ECKO:** You don’t remember what song was playing?

**KANYE WEST:** Nah, it wasn’t really about a song, it was about this great set of titties.

**MARC ECKO:** Man, I had those, too. But I also had Stevie B. [Laughs.] I’m Jersey, man. I can’t help myself.

**KANYE WEST:** These titties were some of the best I’ve ever seen because her areolas were so wide. [Laughs.]

**MARC ECKO:** [Laughs.] I like when the areolas are real contrasty. I like when there’s contrast.

**KANYE WEST:** Nah, see, I’m the opposite. I’m a little more tonal.

**MARC ECKO:** You want them tone-on-tone?

**KANYE WEST:** Yeah.

**MARC ECKO:** Let me ask you something: Why do you think I’m a hater? I get the vibe that you think I’m a hater. Just a cynical, shit-talking — 

**KANYE WEST:** Oh, a pessimist. Yeah, a pessimist and a hater are different because haters are usually like the underdogs. But you’re overdog, so how can you be a hater?

**MARC ECKO:** You must have done really good on your fuckin’ English SATs.

**KANYE WEST:** Yeah, I love semantics.

**MARC ECKO:** Oh, me too. I love words.

**KANYE WEST:** I love lamp [Editor’s note: word to Anchorman]. Some people are optimists and some people are pessimists. I have a pessimist with me all the time: “I keep it real. Niggas don’t like that.”

**MARC ECKO:** Somebody to call shit on you, right?

**KANYE WEST:** Yeah.

**MARC ECKO:** You need that. A lot of people don’t realize that in order to be successful, you need someone to break down that wall and call shit on you.

**KANYE WEST:** Yeah. That’s what’s so dope about the blogs.

**MARC ECKO:** What one thing or person is the definitive muse in your life, that if it just evaporated it’d be a wrap for you as an artist?

**KANYE WEST:** Well, I wouldn’t say it’d be a wrap, but it would definitely change — living with my girl was always one of my muses.

**MARC ECKO:** You’ve been with her a long time, yeah?

**KANYE WEST:** I guess it’s about to be six years.

**MARC ECKO:** Time to get married — that’s a good cooking time, you need time to bake. Do you pick your nose in front of her?

**KANYE WEST:** I pick my nose in front of everybody.

**MARC ECKO:** Do you fart in front of her?

**KANYE WEST:** Nah, I don’t try to fart in front of anybody.

**MARC ECKO:** Oh, dog, when you get married it’s gonna all change! Anyhow, what’s the last time you heard a record that made you jealous?

**KANYE WEST:** I know this statement might come off awkward or whatever, people won’t get the exact translation right, but when I saw the Eve video [for “Tambourine”], it made me want to go back and do more shots [on my video] from a style level. She had the Christopher Kane dress, the vintage Chanel glasses. When I saw her style level in that, it made me say, “Damn, I need to step my style level up.” Because it’s not a matter of just guys’ style and girls’ style or black style and white style, it’s a matter of who is the style god period and shit.

**MARC ECKO:** Right now, in this moment, it seems so about the aesthetic. Which is king, content or aesthetic?

**KANYE WEST:** Well, you focus on the music first. That’s one of the reasons why it took me fuckin’ four months to finish the lyrics on “Stronger,” because the beat was just crazy and I hadn’t had people react to an instrumental like that since “Jesus Walks.” So then it’s like, “OK, we got this song that’s incredible. How do we match up a visual that could be on the same level and have all the layers that the song had?” I love that challenge: How do you become fuckin’ Disney and Shrek and Anchorman, those things that across the board are commercially successful — you know what I’m sayin’.

**MARC ECKO:** Yeah. Both of us have had degrees of crossover success. But we started with kind of a pure, inherent love for some very private club, this hip-hop thing. How do you gauge your music’s ability to cross over?

**KANYE WEST:** If you’re driving a car and you’re trying to get to another lane, you’re looking for your opportunity to get in this lane, right? My goal is to be on the freeway in a fucking plane. In all lanes at all times. The goal is not to cross over, the goal is to try to do the impossible. Like, for me to have a party at the Louis Vuitton store and then to get into the car and hear Kay Slay playing “Can’t Tell Me Nothing” was the greatest accomplishment for me. That was like the airplane thing. You’re in all lanes.

**MARC ECKO:** Louis Vuitton again. How much of that is aspiration, the pursuit of upper-crustedness?

**KANYE WEST:** Life is about “thank you, you’re welcome.” A lot of people would say, “Louis Vuitton should’ve gave you this or that.” But I branded myself with Louis Vuitton by being this guy who does wear Louis Vuitton. It helped bring me to a status where I can wear stuff like Comme des Garçons, which the ’hood doesn’t know about like that.

**MARC ECKO:** You talked about reading the blogs and seeing hate out there on the Internet. 50 Cent on the Clinton Sparks Sirius show and Beanie Sigel on the latest Beef DVD — both guys who you’ve made beats for — are criticizing your style and essentially trying to say you’re gay. But you never respond.

**KANYE WEST:** I never put anybody down to big myself up. I just big myself up. The one time where they could say I dissed somebody is the George Bush thing. But I didn’t say, “Hey, George Bush is a bitch.” I said, “George Bush doesn’t care about black people,” something that came out of an emotion I felt. It wasn’t something I would’ve said just to be bringin’ someone down. Yeah, if I’m in the privacy of my own home, or around my friends, I’ll talk shit about whoever. But I know the power I have; I would never do or say anything to take money out of someone’s mouth.

**MARC ECKO:** [Laughs.] Are you becoming a kinder, gentler Kanye?

**KANYE WEST:** I’m just trying to control my power.

**MARC ECKO:** That’s a good thing, man. That’s a good thing.
