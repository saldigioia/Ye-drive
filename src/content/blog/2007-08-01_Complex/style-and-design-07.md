# Style and Design ’07

## Kanye Breaks Down the a-to-Z of Style's Forward-Thinking Players. Along the Way, He Challenges Five Cutting-Edge Artists to Interpret What Is Sexy.

I apologize for the inconsistency in the formatting. The original text had some sections in all caps and others in regular case. I should have standardized the formatting to make it more consistent and readable.

# A

## Anchorman

Anchorman may be the greatest movie of all time. It's up there with Coming to America, which is my definite, certified most favorite movie ever. After me and Swizz Beatz battled going beat for beat at [New York's Summer Jam in June], he was just glowing that night. He called me; I just said, "Drink it in, it goes down smooth."

# B

## Blogs

We don't have nothing to do in the studio, waiting for the mixdown and times like that. So you get on the computer in the back for a little bit and get on the blogs. Man, it really takes a strong person to read the blogs; it's just no holds barred. So if you're feeling good about yourself and you want to feel like shit, go to the blogs. It's good to have a place for someone to have unabashed opinions. Even if they're dissing me or I'm the butt of jokes, I respect people giving their real opinion.

# C

## Common

Me and Common go way back. It's dope to have really good friends in the industry who make music that's really relevant. Common pushes me and I push him. We both step our rhyme game up because of each other, and he's helped me step my beat game up. We go on tour together, too. I just have a lot of fun gettin' in the studio with him and making music.

# D

## Dries Van Noten

I got familiar with this designer over the past few years, shopping around the world. The hip-hop in me loves crazy patterns; that's a no-brainer jacket because it's high-fashion and 'hood at the same time — which is the ultimate goal when I get dressed.

# E

## Estevan Oriol & Mr. Cartoon

# F

## Feist

Man, I don't know if that's her name or the group name, I just know that it's the type of music that I'm going to play at my wedding.

# G

## Ghita

Cassie wore one of these dresses in the "Stronger" video. Oh, I forgot to mention it's my fiancée's line. Shameless plug! Peep GhitaFashion.com.

## Home

I'm working with Claudio Silvestrin [left], who did my apartment in New York. There's this Japanese dude in the same complex as me and his crib was just so impeccable I would come over and ask him for advice. So one day he said, "Look, I'm just going to tell you some architects," and he named John Paulson, Claudio Silvestrin, and Antonio Citterio. These people are just, like, so at the top of their game, like ridiculous, award-winning, that they don't really do apartments like that. So I reached out to Claudio, then I went to my neighbor and told him, "Claudio's coming in next month." He must have wanted to spit up his drink.

I've been studying architecture since I was 19, and when you know too much you can't just be content with other people's designs. The only type of house that I would get would be a castle or something from the 1920s, an old Victorian or something, but I wouldn't just buy someone else's contemporary home, cause a lot of times these new architects do a lot of arbitrary stuff. It's like, "Why do you have that?"

# I

## iTunes

I'm on iTunes every day of my life. My music is in my iTunes. I even go and use the "Listeners Also Bought." I love that.

# J

## Japan

I think I'm turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so. Man, I knew I was going to love Japan. I went to China with my mother for a year. I was in fifth grade and we couldn't afford to go to Japan, so it was dope to be there and be able to go crazy shopping. But I have a lot of similarities to what I see in the people's culture — when you go to Japan and you see them take on American culture, they do it times 10, whatever it is. If somebody is hip-hop, they'll be dressed better, they'll do it better than an American will do it.

## Karl Lagerfeild

I don't know where to start. I mean, he's a legend. I heard that he and Yves Saint Laurent trained together. Just a living legend.

# M

## Takashi Murakami

As far as art goes, this is no disrespect to Basquiat, but I'm just not into that style at all. When you see Murakami, it's that "I can't do that at home" type thing. I had seen the Louis Vuitton stuff he did, but then my man Don C. put me on to how important an artist he was. And Don C. was buying prints and different things already, so then I started looking at his work. I saw this statue that I loved, "Hiropon."

I was looking to buy the statue, and there's only four of them in the world [Editor's note: One sold in 2002 for $427,500]. Murakami has one, so I went to meet with him just so I could see the statue in person. After I met him, I said, "Man, why don't we draw my Jesus piece together?" We were talking about doing something together and I was like, "Yo, why don't we do the album packaging together?" And he said, "Yeah," and I said, "Thank you?" Now we've been working on it for like a year and a half — he's supposed to be animating the video for this song called "Good Morning."

# N

## Nike

I'm black. That's all I have to say.

# O

## Old School

It's all the craze. Like I said in [Ne-Yo's "Addicted"], my outfit is just so '80s. I'm trendy on purpose. I feel like being trendy is enjoying the moment, like some people go out and drink and have a good time. You need to go out and soak in the moment and take pictures, then look back and be like, "That shit was crazy, man, we used to dress like that?" What I like about the video for "Stronger" is there's a certain reality to it. It's not like a bunch of neon colors on it, like, "This is '80s." There's an authenticity to it: "OK, this is really, really how motherfuckers used to dress."

# P

## Polo

True Polo heads hate me, but as everyone knows, I love me.

# Q

## Quincy Jones

Quincy Jones is a god, just the quintessential — no pun intended — the quintessential producer. He's the end all, be all of production. I'd much rather end up like Quincy Jones than Rick James. And Rick James was hotter than Quincy Jones at one time.

# R

## Brent Rollins (Extraordinaire) (Ego Trip, Designer)

# S

## Hedi Slimane

Hedi Slimane is not even a real person. I'm saying that in the most positive way. Saying that he's not even a human being. Hedi Slimane is truly just a god. Bow in the presence of greatness. I heard that he wasn't going to design anymore. Man, that's like almost as bad as when I heard James Brown died. That just means in two years my jeans are going to be looking ragged because I'm going to be wearing the same shit.

# T

## Todd "Reas" James (Executive Producer Artist, Minoriteam)

# U

## Down Under

I was in Australia meeting with the guys from Ksubi and they said, "There's this girl with this incredible voice, you need to hear it." People say that to me all the time, but I went ahead and listened to it; she ended up on "Can't Tell Me Nothing."

## Video Directors

Directors are my really good friends anyway because we spend a lot of time together. We sit and bullshit and talk about a lot of things. Like this whole "Stronger" thing has been such a journey, but luckily we've had the time to really hash it out and try to think of something really great.

Videos are such a different thing than a movie or a short: to tell a full story in that four minutes and not make it jumpy or cheesy, just to make you invested in whatever that person is going through. A lot of times we go through that with narrative — how much narrative are you going to give? Do you extend the music to tell the story? I've had a few narrative videos, and it's like, how do you infuse the performance and make that make sense? Do you make it all narrative? I definitely study video like that.

All directors have their little idiosyncrasies and stuff, but me and Chris Milk, and me and Hype Williams, have delivered a lot of impactful pieces, I think. Both of them can deliver a video that impacts the world, but each of them have their strong points. Hype's strong points are really performance, and there are times when I think Chris's strong points are concept. Now not that Hype doesn't have good concepts and Chris doesn't have good performance, but sometimes people have certain magic in certain elements. Just like with any artist.

# W

## Lil Wayne

I've done a few beats for him [for Tha Carter 3]. We always talk about how people are going to react once they hear the result, once they see it. And that's the whole thing about being a true entertainer. I've been in the studio with a lot of different people who make music, but Wayne and Jay are two of the people who have major conversations about "When this comes out, people are going to react like this." In the Internet age, people are always looking for something new, something new, something new. He's always giving them something new.

# X

## XXX

They say they caught me with some porn or whatever. I'm 30 years old. I'm too old to be caught with it. I have it. Now what?! I don't know how far I want to promote it, though. Can somebody just book me a show in Brazil?

# Y

## YouTube

I thought it was great market research when I was doing the video for "Stronger." I did a show in Kuala Lumpur, and I performed "Stronger" and everyone who heard it on YouTube saw the crowd going crazy to it. How dope is that? And instead of sending an assistant to find all of the Madonna videos or something like that, I can just go to YouTube and peep it. The only problem I have with YouTube is the clarity. That's why when I drop videos, like when I dropped "Stronger," I post a link to my website, KanyeWest.com.

## ZZZ

After the video for "Stronger," finishing the Graduation album, and editing Complex, I need some Zs.
