# Crazy Love

They were acting like a couple of kids. On the second level of New York City’s FAO Schwarz April 5, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West had taken over the giant floor piano Kim has loved since she saw Big as a kid, and were tapping out a tune. “They were hysterically laughing and having so much fun,” says a witness to the outing on day two of a 48-hour playdate made for tween-at-heart millionaires. Kim had brought West along to the flagship toy store — which hosts more than 10,000 shoppers each day — to pick up gifts for her nephew, Mason Disick, 2. But it had been West’s idea to have the store clear out customers so they could visit a few in-store boutiques — like the Angry Birds shop — undisturbed. As Kim playfully tried on costumes for West’s amusement, more and more fans realized the superstars were in their midst, and began chanting her name. West — as famous for his ego as his talent — “really dug it,” says a mutual pal. “For him, it’s great to hang with someone who’s an equal.”

It might now seem obvious that these two Louis Vuitton-toting tweetaholics would be drawn to each other. But the new romance is the result of months of hot pursuit by West, sparing no expense to win the woman who calls herself “the ultimate doll.” The singer, 34, “has been genuinely head over heels for her for a while,” says the pal. Conveniently, the knight in mink-lined armor arrived just as the damsel, 31, has been feeling like the dating equivalent of “a leper,” says the pal, because of her drawn-out divorce from New Jersey Nets power forward Kris Humphries, 27- “Guys are afraid to even get near her,” says the friend, “and here’s this superstar pursuing her!” Coincidentally for the 24/7 social media junkies, the romance went public just as he was dropping his single “Theraflu,” in which he professes his love for her, and she was appearing on Today April 6. Still, insists the pal, “it’s not a PR stunt. They’re perfect for each other. He thinks she’s his Beyoncé!”

## 48-Hour Date

The fun for the crazy-in-love couple began April 4, when Kim met up with West the day after flying in from LA. Kim had tweeted she was dying to see The Hunger Games, so it was West’s first order of business, sneaking through a side entrance of the busy Regal Cinemas in Union Square. “During the movie they shared a popcorn,” says a source. Afterward, the duo hit NYCs buzziest show, Sleep No More, an interactive theater piece at the McKittrick Hotel loosely based on Macbeth. Attendees are required to wear Venetian carnival-style masks, and actors — some nude — simulate sex and roam about the haunted hotellike setting with the audience. “Kim and Kanye wore the masks and didn’t bring any security,” says a source. “They wandered through the show together.” After the finale, the 18-time Grammy winner led her to the hotel’s Manderley Bar, where they listened to Stella St. Clair croon ‘40s songs.

Not wanting the evening to end — or perhaps trying to woo her into a sleepover — West played to Kim’s famous sweet tooth and took her to the tourist ice cream mecca Serendipity 3. Seated at Marilyn Monroe’s favorite table in the restaurant’s intimate side room, they shared a Frrrozen Hot Chocolate and “Big Apple” Pie. After West’s full-court press, says a source, “she spent the night at his place,” a $2.7 million apartment in SoHo that’s so minimalist, its main materials are French limestone and pearwood (paradise for clean freak Kim).

Having won her over, West set his sights on Kim’s friends. The next day, the duo took her pals — including BFF Simon Huck and makeup artist Joyce Bonelli — to lunch at Serafina, where West downplayed his self-centered image over truffle pizza, says a source. Unlike Humphries, who never passed the friendsand-family test, “Kanye seemed very at ease with everyone at lunch,” says the source. “He’s actually a realty good listener.” And he was quite a gentleman. “When they left, he helped her put on her jacket and adjusted her collar the cute way boyfriends do,” says a witness.

After the 45-minute trip to FAO, the pair and friends hopped into matching silver Maybachs and headed downtown to the high-end clothing store Jeffrey. West, a notorious clotheshorse who rubs YSL-clad shoulders with Vogue’s AnnaWintour, “was helping Kim pick out things,” says a staffer at the Meatpacking District shop. “They were very playful.” Says the pal, “They’re both major shoppers, so they were loving life! She got a ton.” The staffer adds, “Kim actually paid for her own stuff.” That’s a novelty for West, who is more accustomed to squiring models like Amber Rose and Selita Ebanks. “Kim can pay her own way and she’s not riding his coattails,” says the mutual friend. “He loves that she’s a powerful business lady.”

That night they had a dietbusting meal at Cafeteria, munching on fried chicken and waffles as well as mac ’n’ cheese. Calling it an early night — she had to wake up at dawn to appear on Today — they bunked at Kim’s hotel, the Trump SoHo. Asked by Ann Curry the next day about the public displays of affection, Kim played coy. “Kanye and I have been friends for years,” she said, but “you never know what the future holds.”

## Pals to Lovers

No one knows that better than West, who has dreamed of being with Kim since they met through her former friend Brandy. (West produced Brandy’s 2004 single “Talk About Our Love.”) “Kanye has been heavily pursuing Kim for a long time and it was just never right for either of them,” says the Kim source. In his song “Theraflu” he says that he missed his chance when she wed Humphries. “And I’ll admit I fell in love with Kim around the same time she fell in love with him,” he raps. “Well that’s cool, baby girl, do your thing. Lucky I ain’t have Jay drop him from the team.” (Pal Jay-Z co-owns Humphries’ team, the New Jersey Nets.)

Though West’s ex Rose — who is also dissed in the song — blamed their summer 2010 split on Kim, the Kardashian source claims the new pair didn’t speak during most of 2011, out of respect to her relationship with Humphries. When they did meet up, after her family attended West’s December 13 L.A. concert, Kim was still too shell-shocked from Hurricane Humphries to even consider it. As she assured Us, “I’m not looking to date.” West, however, remained persistent, and in March begged her to come to Paris for his Kanye West line fashion show. Kim relented, flying out for a whirlwind 10 hours, and was rewarded with a pair of $6,000 calfskin and pearl heels that West designed for the Giuseppe Zanotti label.

In the City of Light, West opened the door to Kim’s heart just a crack, but she still needed convincing. “After Paris, she realized Kanye is such a good person,” says the Kim source. But before jumping in headfirst, she had to wash one last man out of her extensions: Reggie Bush, the Miami Dolphin she has had an on-again, off-again romance with since 2007 “She went to see Reggie and he couldn’t be faithful,” says the source. “He had a Kim look-alike around two days after Kim’s visit. She was fed up.”

Realizing her dream of life with Bush was over, Kim finally gave in to West “Now that Kim has gotten over the Kris drama and let Reggie go in her heart,” says the Kim source, “she sees how much Kanye loves her.”

## Under Fire

While Kim was open to taking West — who a source says is well-liked by the Kardashian clan — home for Easter in California, he had to jet to Qatar to do a short film. But even though they’re apart, the KimYe storm continues. The Wall Street Journal, for one, questioned their dating motives, asking, “Is It Real or Marketing?” And hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons defended them online, writing, “Kim, who is still making so much money being Kim, is not looking at Kanye’s money as a reason to date him … so we know Kanye ain’t saying she’s a gold digger!” Explains the pal, “I can understand why everyone would think it was a stunt, but they are perfect for each other and Kanye is what Kim needs.” If anything, adds the source, this may be the most truthful love she’s had yet. “She was with cowardly guys like Reggie, who was obsessed with what his teammates thought, and Kris, who didn’t want her to act too strong,” says the source. “But Kanye loves her Kimness. She’s great the way she is and if people hate on them, hell only like her more.”

# Her Ex Reacts!

Not only is Kanye West dating the woman who is still technically Kris Humphries’ wife — he’s also threatening his job! “It’s not fair,” a Humphries pal says of West’s “Theraflu” lyric, in which he implies he could have his pal Jay-Z, part owner of the New Jersey Nets, fire him. “Jay can’t kick people off the team.” As for the romance, “Kris knew Kim would get together with Kanye,” says the pal. “We think it’s a distraction to get her name unattached from the divorce mess.”

Ouch! A pal says Humphries is a fan of West.
