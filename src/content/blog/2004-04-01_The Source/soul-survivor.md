# Soul Survivor

Labor Day Weekend is one of the saddest times of the year. Summer's coming to a close, and the first hints of autumn are already popping up. Nonetheless, families are strolling Lake Michigan's shoreline, enjoying the last three-day weekend before the little tykes head back to school. And over in the heart of the North Side, faithful Chicago Cubs fans cheer their hapless squad during a doubleheader with the Milwaukee Brewers. But in the nearby village of Tinley Park, Illinois, something special is brewing for another underdog from the Chi.

The Tweeter Center is the setting for the Sprite Liquid Mix Tour, and one of the Windy City's own is ready for the spotlight. Producer Kanye West is already signed to Roc-A-Fella Records as a solo artist, but the official announcement has yet to take place. Backstage, there's a little more blunt-smoking than usual, but Kanye isn't partaking of it. Actually, the sheer amount of smoke is giving him a contact high. Rocking a crimson-and-white Team Canada warm-up jacket, Mr. West is clashing with his Rocawear and throwback-clad crew, which he'll soon join onstage.

Before Jay-Z's headlining set winds down, Hov pulls Kanye aside, whispers in his ear, and then hands him the precious mic. Kanye nods and then announces to the crowd: "I'm the newest member of the Roc-A-Fella team/ And I'ma make Dame and Hov mad more cream." The audience is now roaring for their fellow Chicagoan. Damon Dash, the George Steinbrenner of Hip-Hop, places the platinum-and-gold Roc chain around Kanye's neck, and the union is complete. With confidence overflowing, Kanye is now eager to show off his lyrical prowess, which has been questioned by some. But according to him, he would have been better off calling it a night after getting chained.

"About six bars in, I'm completely bombing," remembers Kanye almost two years later. "I was spitting a wack-ass rap and completely embarrassing the entire Roc-A-Fella staff to the point where I can imagine what the conversations were like on the tour bus."

Though his tenure as a solo artist was off to an inauspicious start, Kan' was determined to get his respect as an MC. Over the next 16 months, he would work tirelessly on his craft and shamelessly promote himself as an artist to anyone with a pulse. Which brings us to.

### Chicago: December 19, 2003

It's tough to remain humble when Jay-Z shouts you out as a genius on a record. Luckily, Kanye is taking Hova's "Lucifer" blessing in stride as he arrives at Chicago's Prosser Career Academy High School for a surprise concert. "Every month, I seem less arrogant because I have accomplished something else I said I was going to do," says the remarkably self-aware 26-year-old. Before getting out of his rented minivan, he makes a prediction: "I think there will be one glimmering moment in time where I will be the No. 1 rap artist in the game."

On this last Friday before Christmas, Kanye West is closer to fulfilling that prophecy than even he knows. His first single, "Through the Wire," has gone from a hometown hit to one of BET's most-played videos, and at press time, "Slow Jamz," a collaboration with Twista and Jamie Foxx, was on its way to becoming the No. 1 song in the country. But no amount of radio spins or industry hubbub can compare to the love he's about to receive.

His short walk to the high school's entrance is disrupted by a teenage girl's amorous catcalls from a second-floor window. Inside the building, security guards struggle to keep students from rushing into their morning assembly. However, the excitement stops when the inner-city school's auditorium's sound system crashes. Ain't budget cuts a bitch? But Kanye still rips through rousing.

"Me breaking my mouth was like a parent hitting a shorty so he knows how to act. God was saying, 'Kanye, I'm about to give you the world. Don't misuse it." a cappellas of "Through the Wire,” "Slow Jamz" and "Champions."

Following his unexpected improvised performance, Kanye hops offstage and, hustling past admirers, spots a young girl sobbing. This hysterical response is what Kanye West envisioned when he started rapping back in 3rd grade. But instead of relishing the moment, the voices of skeptics are filling his head, competing with the kids' cheers.

"When I first heard him, I really didn't think much of him as a rapper just because I didn't feel it was anything he should have been pursuing," says Dame Dash. "I thought he would be better off doing a compilation."

Kanye didn't listen to his notoriously demanding boss and is now on the verge of stardom. As he gets back in the van to head to another school concert, his first words vindicate him. "People said I couldn't rap, and everybody said it's based on the beats," he says in an acidic tone. "But I didn't hear no beats right there."

Producing hit records for some of the best-selling artists in music is a hell of a moonlighting gig for most folks, but that's not why Kanye got in the biz. If he was merely a great producer, lovelorn teenage girls wouldn't be crying over him, security guards at malls wouldn't be asking for his autograph, and you can bet his "tantrums" at photo shoots wouldn't wind up in the New York Post's Page Six. That type of life would be as ill-fitting to the self-proclaimed best-dressed rapper as a dashiki worn with a nylon tracksuit. Why? Because Kanye West was born to be a star.

"All my songs are about something negative and how God can help you through it. Like how a minister will bring up problems, I do that lyrically. I have a responsibility to Black men."

Kanye West had no rhythm as a child. His mother, Dr. Donda West, an English professor at Chicago State University, laughs about her son's uneducated feet but insists her only child was a born performer, always enamored of the spotlight.

"In kindergarten, Kanye was running his mouth, so his teacher kicked him out of the Christmas play," recalls Dr. West. "[Then] I saw this little boy onstage playing Santa Claus and noticed he had the same black boots as Kanye. Lo and behold, the kid who was to be Santa Claus got stage fright when it was time to go on, and Kanye said, 'I'll do it.' So, Kanye got to be the star of the show."

Raised in a middle-class household, Kanye didn't exactly live his hard-knock life. He was computer-literate by the age of 5 and got his Air-Jordans the same way most other non-delinquents did—his mom bought them for him. Growing up, Kanye was perceived by his peers as a loner and often spent hours in his bedroom, which became a makeshift studio after he purchased some computer music programs he had seen in a classified ad. "Kanye always went against the grain," says Shawnna from Disturbing the Peace, who has known him since the 5th grade. "He was never eager to please the cool people. If they didn't want to hang with him, he was like, 'So what? I'm doing this over here.

Marchin to the beat of his own drummer, soon led Kanye to a basement apartment on East 82nd and Paxton Street owned by one Rashied Lynn on the South Side. In 1995, Lynn, aka Common Sense, had just released the classic Resurrection and provided a human litmus test to Kanye and his friends, all aspiring MCs.

"Their whole mentality was, If I could rip this cat, I could do records," Says Common. "Kanye was really good, and you couldn't half-step when [battling] him. I always felt a certain drive in Kanye that was unnatural." Before finding his voice, the experimenting rapper cops to sounding like Raekwon, Nas, and, of course, his favorite rapper of all time, Mase.

"At that point, I hadn't really found myself," says Kanye. "I was just a cheap knock-off." Despite the low marks in MCing-Lord knows how Kool Moe Dee would have graded him back then —and the high marks in college, Kanye dropped out of Chicago State University during his second semester.

When Kanye West left school in 1996, he dreamed of platinum plaques lining his walls, not diplomas, and his mother was initially disappointed by her son's decisions. "As an educator. decided there was no way a child of mine would not have at least one degree," says Dr. West, sounding eerily like a skit on her son's album. "But it was apparent to me he was moving ahead with his dreams." Kanye's American Idol aspirations seemed within reach when he flew to New York for a meeting with Columbia Records. He was close to getting signed, but his lofty boasts caught the wrong ears.

"I met with Mike Mauldin [at Columbia Records], and I said, I want to be bigger than Michael Jackson. I want to be bigger than Jermaine Dupri," he recalls. "I was just saying that to pump myself up to them, but I didn't know Dupri's real last name was Mauldin and that he was [Mike Mauldin's] son. Then I was hit with those three words: 'We'll call you.'

Forget a deal; Kanye couldn't even catch a cab after that meeting, and he headed by to his mom's pad in Chicago. "One summer, he was totally destitute and didn't have money for a haircut or gas for his car," says Dr. West. "But never once did Kanye get distraught enough to quit." With some willing mentors, Kanye improved his production skills. He picked up acute sampling tips from No. I.D. and refined his drums with the help of Dug Infinite. Working under Deric "D-Dot" Angelittie, Kanye logged some early production credits and then hooked up with former Roc-A-Fella A&R Hip-Hop, who introduced him to Jay-Z. But ironically, his achievements behind the boards would only hinder his dogged pursuit for solo stardom.

"No label would sign me," says Kanye, who played future hits "Jesus Walks" and "Two Words" for potential suitors. "There would always be someone saying, 'He's just a producer.' I just hope those people read these words. Read them and weep."

Kanye eventually signed to Roc-A-Fella Records in July 2002 and continued to work on his debut album until a near-fatal event changed his life. In October 2002, he was involved in a serious car accident in L.A. Having suffered multiple facial injuries, including a broken jaw, Kanye's career was in jeopardy.

"Me breaking my mouth right before it was my time to shine was like a parent hitting a short, so he knows how to act," he says of the disaster that wrought "Through the Wire."

"Basically, God was saying, 'Kanye, I'm about to give you the world. Don't misuse it.'* The inspirational "Through the Wire," recorded while his mouth was wired shut, personifies Kanye's greatest quality as an MC: his ability to inject humor into the most harrowing personal experiences described in his lyrics. "All my songs are about something that was negative and how God can help you through it," he says. "Like how a minister will bring up problems in service; I try to do that lyrically. I have a responsibility to other Black men around me to help us make sane decisions and use our heads instead of always trying to look cool."

Realizing he may be getting a tad preachy, he quickly adds, "The thing is, I'm not no lame. I still like girls and everything." Ironically, his biggest hit to date, Twista's "Slow Jamz,” is a lighthearted party romp dedicated to the ladies. With its jabs at Michael Jackson, it became the number-one record in the country this February, but Kanye remembers when not everyone was keen on his quiet storm.

"Fucking critics tried to judge it and thought the song was a joke," he says. "It was Jay-Z's idea to take "Slow Jamz" off my album and give it to Twista. That way, I got a promotion, and Twista got a smash single. Jay-Z's a genius. What more can I say?"

Following a whirlwind day of publicity, Kanye West is attempting to relax at Chicago's pos W Hotel. Lying horizontally across the plush queen-size bed, he's on his cellphone discussing the final writing splits for The College Dropout while devouring some peanut M&Ms. Members of his entourage joke about the hectic itineraries, but his work ethic is what elevated "Through the Wire" from a feel-good local hit to a national anthem.

And once "Slow Jamz" hit, Kanye West immediately became not only a top priority at Def Jam but also the first superstar in the post-Jay-Z era of Roc-A-Fella Records. Surprisingly, taking umbrage at such statements was label-mate Memphis Bleek. "Kanye didn't put in no work," Bleek said in a December 2003 interview published online. "I didn't know a new artist can be mentioned in the same sentence as me and Beans so quickly."

Not only is Kanye eager to quell talk of any problems, he agrees with Bleek's comments. 'He's right," Kanye says. "I wasn't there, and I didn't pay all the dues they been through to build up Roc-A-Fella. I'm just kind of riding the wave. Bleek showed me some of the most love. So regardless of whatever they wanted to print on the Internet, I know what relationship me and Bleek have personally."

While he respects colleagues like Bleek, Kanye speaks of Shawn Carter in a reverent tone. That makes the events on Nov. 25, 2003, seem even stranger. Conspicuous by his absence at Jay-Z's farewell show was Kanye West, a man responsible for many of the hits performed that evening

"I know the [September 2002 concert] stuck in Jay-Z's memory," he says. "Everyone knows I might do some shit to completely embarrass them. So, Jay-Z didn't want to take any chances with the loose cannon of Roc-A-Fella Records. I was definitely hurt when I was not on that stage... [But] if anybody owes me nothing, it's Jay-Z. He's done so much for me."

The in-house relationships may be solid, but there's been grumbling from an old Chicago associate, producer Icedrake [Mike Guy], the younger brother of Shawna. Drake claimed that he and Kanye were a production duo and insinuated he was cut out of potential work with D-Dot back in the late-'90s, something Kanye brushes off. "He is one of the main reasons I change my cellphone number all the time," he laughs. "Look at my personality. Do you think I would be in a production group with someone? My whole shit is I want to show what I can do on my own."

Tonight, Dec. 19, 2003, Kanye West is once again performing in front of over 20,000 people in his hometown at WGC's Big Jam holiday concert at the United Center. Because of his hectic schedule, there's a sense of urgency back at the W. Clothes are scattered everywhere like it's the first day of school-"This is what happens when you have no stylist, and you care about clothes" —and he still manages an 11th-hour trip to the Louis Vuitton store on Chicago's Magnificent Mile to cop a $400 pair of gray sneakers and a $900 blue backpack. When Kanye hits the stage, he atones for his flunked exam back in September 2002.

"I wish Jay would come to one of my shows and see how the people love me now,' he says. "Because I look up to him so much, I want him to be proud of what I built... The most unlikely to succeed commanding 20,000 people and helping the Roc-A-Fella legacy live on."

With past experiences motivating him, Kanye West is fulfilling the unrealistic expectations he set for himself in grammar school. And now that The College Dropout sold 441,000 copies, its first week, for once in his career. Kanye West is not the underdog. He's triumphed over everything from car accidents to his own temperament but is still welcoming cynics, almost out of habit.

"Can you really say at this point there is something impossible for Kanye West? That there is a wall or ceiling, you can put to the man?" he crows after learning of his first week estimates. The subtle smirk on his face has no quickly morphed into a grin as if he's admiring his own gall. He then sits back and continues without a hint of humility, "Or are you finally going to say, 'Damn, if he said it, there might just be a chance?’”
