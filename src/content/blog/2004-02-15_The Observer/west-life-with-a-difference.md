# West Life - With a Difference

2003 should have belonged — at least in part — to 26-year-old Chicagoan Kanye West. Best known as the young producer who had made Jay-Z’s Blueprint album a musical tour de force in 2001, West finally got his own deal in 2002. He had always rapped, but it was his instantly recognisable way of speeding up old soul records and doctoring beats for bigger stars that made his name. He wrote the music to ’03 Bonnie & Clyde’ for Jay-Z, ‘Stand Up’ for Ludacris, ‘You Don’t Know My Name’ for Alicia Keys, and last week’s US No 1 single, Twista’s ‘Slow Jamz’. Word of his own witty, moving raps was just beginning to spread when a car crash put him in hospital in October 2002, his jaw broken in three places. His album went on hold.

But rapping didn’t. ‘Through the Wire’ — its spittle-flecked vocal recorded with West’s jaw wired shut — attests to his determination to get his words out there. ‘Thank God I ain’t too cool for the safe belt,’ is just the tip of an iceberg of humour, autobiography, polemic, self-deprecation, satire and warmth that dominates College Dropout , released this week into a swell of anticipation. West is a brilliant social commentator, unafraid to tackle subjects as sensitive as the materialism in black culture (‘Couldn’t afford a car/ So she named her daughter Alexus’), the futility of education if racism bars black achievers from good jobs (‘School Spirit’) and, not least, his own position. As the self-proclaimed ‘first nigga with a Benz and a backpack’, West straddles two radically polarised worlds, that of A-list bling, and the socially conscious underground.

It’s this very tension between hip hop’s glamour and everyday struggle that makes College Dropout (and West) so terrific. That, and all the knock-down classics that suggest hip-hop bosses were mad not to sign him years ago.

When West does touch on gangsta subjects, he does it with style. Children sing ‘Drug dealing just to get by/ Stack your money ’til it gets sky high,’ (‘We Don’t Care’) where West displays pride in the resilience of the underclass, even as he lampoons its worst excesses. College Dropout is no dry, worthy record, either: West’s pedigree as a hitmaker means that every track sounds like a chart-topping monster.

‘Slow Jamz’, featuring Twista, is a case in point. A laid-back seduction track ‘for the ladies’, venerating and exploiting classic lovers’ music, it appears on both College Dropout and Twista’s own debut album, Kamikaze . The latter, though, is somewhat overshadowed by West’s outing. A veteran whose guest spots have paid his way thus far, Twista’s verbal diarrhoea is a bit much to take over 16 tracks, no matter how impressive or dexterous his flow. After the genius of Kanye West, all his talk of pimps, drinks and sex feels positively prehistoric.
