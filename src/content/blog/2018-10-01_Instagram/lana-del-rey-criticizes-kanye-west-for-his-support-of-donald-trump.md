# Lana Del Rey Criticizes Kanye West for His Support of Donald Trump

Trump becoming our president was a loss for the country but your support of him is a loss for the culture.

I can only assume you relate to his personality on some level. Delusions of Grandeur, extreme issues with narcissism - none of which would be a talking point if we weren't speaking about the man leading our country.

If you think it's alright to support someone who believes it's OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he's famous-then you need an intervention as much as he does- something so many narcissists will never get because there just isn't enough help for the issue.

Message sent with concern that will never be addressed.
