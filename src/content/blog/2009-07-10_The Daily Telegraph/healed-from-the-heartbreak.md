# Healed From the Heartbreak

Pioneering hip hop star Kanye West toured Britain last year to rave reviews for his fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak. The record — a bold departure from his usual sample-heavy, dance-friendly hits — had West's own heartbreak as its focus: the death of his mother followed by the split with his fiancee. The distorted vocals and old-fashioned drum machines were hailed as a brave triumph that revealed the soul of the previously guarded and haughty artist.

Since then, West has diversified into working with various fashion lines, producing other music acts and directing videos.

It was intriguing, then, to see what would emerge at Hyde Park. Bordered by jagged silver plates that made the set look like a cavity inside a diamond, West cut an impressive figure against a kaleidoscopic LED strip. Tribal drumbeats and the Auto-tuned sound of tracks from 808s and Heartbreak added to the other-worldly feel of the performance.

But although the newer songs have a quiet intensity and poignancy to them, it was the oldies — songs built around samples of Shirley Bassey's Diamonds Are Forever and Ray Charles's I've Got a Woman — that roused the crowd. And when he turned to the classics of his debut album, The College Dropout, the evening picked up again.

An influence on that breakthrough was the first album West ever bought, The Low End Theory, by A Tribe Called Quest, and so it was fitting that their former frontman Q-Tip performed before him. During a superb show, the veteran hip-hopper paid tribute to Michael Jackson. But his successor did not mention him once; there was no room for two kings.

At one point clouds of gold fragments were released, casting a glow in the air. On the evidence of his most recent album, and this twisting and inventive show, West continues to have the Midas touch.
