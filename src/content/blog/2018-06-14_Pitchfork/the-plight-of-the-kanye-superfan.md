# The Plight of the Kanye Superfan

## No Rap Star Asks More of His Followers. By and Large, They’re Fine With That.

Over the last three years, Chris Lambert and Travis Bean have logged more than 200 hours recording their thoughts on Kanye West. To them, Kanye isn’t just a great pop star—he’s a master artist whose work is so deliberate and rich with meaning that it holds up to the most exacting scrutiny. They make an impressive case, too. On their podcast “Watching the Throne,” the two sometimes devote multiple hours to a single song, drawing on their backgrounds in film criticism as they scour every lyric for subtext, moral quandaries, and Biblical parallels. They break down the rapper’s intentions with the thoroughness of cool Comp Lit professors, expounding on how My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy borrows its structure from The Wizard of Oz or how a seemingly throwaway adlib is actually a metaphor for Kanye’s sexual compulsions.

Lambert lights up when discussing almost anything related to Kanye, especially his creative process and artistic intentions. But when asked about the rapper’s embrace of Donald Trump in the messy runup to his eighth album, ye, Lambert’s face sinks. He admits that Kanye’s recent doubling down on his support for a president who seemingly delights in exacerbating issues of racism and discrimination in America—issues that Kanye himself has railed against throughout his career—is hard to defend. Nonetheless, Lambert takes a deep breath and dutifully offers the best explanation he can, arguing Kanye’s comments weren’t intended as a political statement.

“Kanye wasn’t chanting ‘build that wall’ or anything like that,” Lambert explains. “He was specifically talking about communication, and that Trump talked in ways that weren’t politically correct, that there was a new way of speaking and a futurism at work.” Lambert’s cohost Bean adds that being a Kanye fan sometimes means accepting that his behavior isn’t always as thought-out as his music. “When he’s out in public—doing interviews, the Trump stuff, whatever he’s trying to convey—his vision is often lost, and that’s just the fault of Kanye.”

Even for an artist with a long history as a lightning rod, this spring’s controversy felt different. It wasn’t only the Trump comments: At the nadir of his PR spiral, Kanye appeared on “TMZ Live” and suggested that slavery was a choice, a remark so abhorrent that it felt like it could be his cultural death knell.

And yet, according to Beats 1 DJ and Kanye superfan Nile “LowKey” Ivey, anybody expecting a mass exodus of diehard devotees doesn’t understand the bond these fans have with Kanye’s music. “There are things that Kanye has done and has put into his music that a lot of people can relate to,” he says. “Being an outcast. Growing up in a rough city. Feeling like an outsider. Doing things that people said you couldn’t do. Rising to the top and being the best out. Kanye has given us all these things. I keep going back to that point of relatability, because a lot of artists don’t give us that.

“Music means a lot to people,” he continues. “It saves people from suicide, from the bad things in their lives, and Kanye has been explicit about what it saved him from. So people pull from those elements and think they got to be the knight in shining armor to save Kanye in return: ‘I gotta be that fan that defends him no matter what!’ I know that sounds ridiculous, but that’s the mindset. I don’t agree with it, but I understand it.”

Even a cursory scroll through Kanye’s online fan circles attests to how deep his followers’ loyalty runs. Kanye has the almost unwavering support of a vast, endlessly forgiving community of fans spread across Twitter, Reddit, and in particular the website Kanye to The (KTT), one of the internet’s busiest and most influential rap message boards.

At any point of the day, it’s not unusual to find more than 6,000 active KTT users engaged in conversations spread across hundreds of unruly threads, some of which span hundreds of thousands of messages. To an outsider, the forum is practically impenetrable, an infinite scroll of emojis, memes, shit posts, and in-jokes. The forum’s mostly twentysomething, mostly male regulars communicate in short, hurried jabs of thought, writing as if they have better places to be even though, to judge from the frequency of their posts, many of them do not.

There is substantial conversation on KTT, but you have to dig to find it. Mostly the regulars just kill time, debating music and fashion, pouring over the most inconsequential leaked news and gossip, lusting after Kim Kardashian, or hazing each other. Somehow they never tire of ranking Kanye’s albums—it’s their default hot-stove debate, and it occurs daily—or rehashing old battles about Drake or J. Cole. But on a Thursday last month, ahead of a flood of new Kanye projects and with the forum’s namesake in the news constantly, there were more pertinent issues to discuss. Users debated the veracity of a supposedly leaked album cover making the rounds on Twitter. “The cover is fake,” a user with the handle Banana Lero wrote. “Kanye is too passionate about fonts to use Helvetica on two straight albums.”

Like many forum regulars, 24-year-old Mikey Vercetti of Danville, Virginia, believes Kanye gets a bad rap and sees the backlash to his Trump comments as part of a pattern. “People weren’t trying to see it from his point of view or learn where he was coming from when he said it,” Vercetti tells me. “A lot of people have to have something to be mad about. They see things and they go, ‘OK, we gotta cancel Kanye.’ But they didn’t think beyond that.”

Vercetti discovered the Kanye to The forum about four years ago while searching for fashion inspiration and gradually got sucked into its culture. “KTT is how I learned to troll people,” he says. “I’ll say something, and if you get mad about it it’s not my fault. You’re the one mad about it. That’s how a lot of people on the forum post.” He’s gotten so used to trolling, he says, that he’s started doing it offline, too. “You know how Kanye said the slavery thing with no context? A lot of times I say things now in real life with no context just to get a rise.”

Given their shared knack for provocation, Kanye’s fans say it was almost inevitable that their hero, a producer who was told he could never rap, would see some of himself in Trump, a businessman who nobody believed could be president. The parallels between the two are lost on no one: Both are high achieving narcissists, cults of personality whose biggest believers will always be themselves. And no matter how much they accomplish, both will always be seen on some level as underdogs by their most loyal supporters. But while there are elements of both Trump and Kanye’s bases that clearly relish in watching their idols ruffle feathers, the Kanye internet isn’t nearly as venomous as the darker corners of the alt-right internet.

Despite its rampant trolling, KTT is a community, and not an entirely unloving one. In a thread from this spring, a 20-year-old board regular named Spanky announced that he had stage four cancer and vowed to fight it. Within mere weeks, though, the severity of his condition became clear, and he broke the news the board had been fearing: “I’m going to pretty much get morphine tomorrow and pass out and never wake up.”

He spent his final hours posting from the ICU. “I love everyone here,” he wrote in his farewell post. “This site isn’t only about music but it’s about bringing together a group of people to discuss anything that’s on their minds.”

The ensuing wake played out in a deluge of sad Don Draper and crying Michael Jordan memes, but was no less heartbreaking for it. The regulars grieved for Spanky like family. Some kept refreshing the thread, hoping against hope that he would return for one last post. Others shared farewell messages he may not have been alive to read: “I love you man,” a user named HFM wrote. “My Cole hate was never personal.”

Even Kanye’s biggest supporters will admit that defending him takes a toll. Chyna Johnson, 27, is a proud fan who recalls the high of going to an All Kanye Night in Los Angeles, a dance party sponsored by the fan Twitter account TeamKanyeDaily. “I went by myself, but in that room we all had that one thing in common,” she says. “When you meet other Kanye people, they’re all the same people. We all vibed; we had no arguments. I was like, ‘This is the best night of my life!’”

But as such a vocal fan, Johnson felt the heat from Kanye’s Trump comments firsthand. “That was a really tough week for me,” she recalls, “because everyone who knows me feels like I’m the only Kanye fan in the world. The slave comments—people were really upset. My grandpa called me like, ‘You like this guy?’ I was doing PR work all week for free.”

Patrick Riedy, 33, a longtime KTT regular who’s been frequenting rap forums for well over a decade, says he’s lost his will to defend the rapper’s more erratic behavior over the years. “He’s been doing weird shit forever and always will,” Riedy says. “I’m always going to be a fan of his music, but now I’m too old and tired to defend him to family members. Every time he comes up in the news I just sigh.”

And yet, Riedy adds, as tempting as it would be to give up on Kanye altogether, he has a long history of being vindicated: “It’s so easy to rag on the guy, but one thing people don’t take into account is how a lot of the shit he says he’ll do, he delivers on.”

Talk to any Kanye fan long enough, and eventually they’ll point to some anecdote about Kanye succeeding against the odds or proving wrong the skeptics that doubted him. His origin myth, that ascent from overlooked producer to rapper to superstar, holds such a primal appeal that fans still project themselves onto him years after he shed the last vestiges of his everyman persona. This is where their view of Kanye deviates most from the rest of the world’s. To them, he isn’t just an enigma, or a talented artist who plays a little fast and loose with the spotlight. He’s an inspiration. He empowers them. Some say they’ve started dressing better because of him. Others say he’s made them more confident about their own opinions, which may be why they’re so willing to ignore some of his less popular ones.

Any new Kanye album is a big deal, but the stakes were palpably higher this time. In the lead-up to ye, many fans told me they were taking a cautious wait-and-see approach to the record after his Trump comments, hoping the new music might provide an explanation. For some, their very fandom was on the line.

And then, with typical showmanship, Kanye unveiled the album on a global livestream from the middle of a ranch in Wyoming. It’s not the record most fans expected. His followers were primed for a political album, but instead, ye is unwaveringly personal in scope, a seven-song meditation on marriage, fatherhood, and mental illness that, save for a stray line about his TMZ antics, generally pretends that Kanye’s MAGA phase never even happened.

The critical response to ye was lukewarm, with most agreeing that, while the album may have not been a disaster, it’s a considerable step down from its predecessors. By and large, though, his supporters aren’t disappointed. Johnson never doubted that she’d love the new album, and sure enough, she does. Vercetti says he actually cried when he heard opener “I Thought About Killing You” for the first time. The “Watching the Throne” guys find the record as thrilling and thematically rich as they hoped; they fired off an enthusiastic first-reactions podcast within a day.

On KTT, even users who initially blasted the album as Kanye’s worst warm to it after a few listens. “I’m just sitting here waiting for 10 threads over the next few days saying ‘the album grew on me [and] it might be his best’ like usual,” one user snarks. Some regulars in particular connect deeply with its depiction of bipolar depression. “Not to sound corny but if you deal [with] mental health issues like me I feel like this resonates 50x better,” YeezyYeezyNY writes. Another user who goes by bigmusicguy echoes that sentiment: “Thanks for talking about your mental health the way you do Kanye. It makes me feel better about myself.”

And yet, despite the belief that their guy came through for them in the end, to the non-apologist, ye can’t help but feel anticlimactic. After all that controversy, this is all we get? Where are the explanations? Why, between ye and Kids See Ghosts, Kanye’s collaboration with Kid Cudi that followed the very next week, are we still no closer to understanding what he was thinking with that Trump spectacle?

Spencer Wolff, a regular in Reddit and Twitter circles of Kanye fandom, is fine not knowing. Wolff helped popularize a theory that Kanye’s Trump statements must have been some of kind of performance art in the vein of the late comedian and wrestler of women, Andy Kaufman. After a few listens to ye, he can’t say whether his theory has been proven right or wrong, or whether it even matters. “I don’t know if he ever reveals this giant performance art,” Wolff tells me. “Andy Kaufman never said he was doing performance art. I don’t know if Kanye ever has to come out and say, ‘Here’s what’s going on.’”

Asked if some Kanye supporters ever seem to give him too much of the benefit of the doubt, Wolff concedes that, yeah, they probably do. So what would it take for Kanye to lose the support of his base?

“At this point, I really don’t know,” Wolff says. “Honestly, he’d have to stop making good music.”
