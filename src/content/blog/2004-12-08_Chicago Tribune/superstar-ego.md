# Superstar Ego

Tuesday must have been awful for Kanye West. A mere 10 Grammy nominations can’t possibly satisfy a superstar whose ego is as towering as his musical prowess. West received nods for best new artist, album of the year and practically everything else, but he must be brooding about his exclusion from the polka and chamber-music categories.

The Chicago-bred superstar made a huge stink last month after departing the American Music Awards without a single trophy besides his date for the evening. Instead, Usher and 2004 Grammy champs OutKast whipped out a king-sized can of whoop-ass and carted off a mantle-collapsing collection of statues. “I felt like I was definitely robbed ... I was the best new artist this year,” West griped to mtv.com.

He might have a point. West was everywhere in 2004, producing, touring and dressing like he just stepped from the pages of “Yachting World” magazine. Now he’s leading the Grammy pack. He deserves to win—just ask him. At a press conference Tuesday, West told reporters that he had written his Grammy speech four years ago.

But Kanye shouldn’t clear a space in his trophy case just yet. After all, Grammy is infamous for acting more like someone’s granny than a keen judge of musical talent. The organization is still smarting from Jethro Tull’s victory over Metallica in the hard rock/ metal category eons ago, and who can forget the Milli Vanilli debacle? Plus, it was only this year that Grammy entered the digital age and added the long-overdue electronic category. (Sorry, Kanye, you didn’t make the cut for that one, either.)

Given the generally bland tastes of Grammy voters, one wonders if the awards are an accurate barometer of high quality hip-hop. The top prizes often don’t go to the most deserving artists, and the organization has consistently favored toothy fare over experimental and street sounds. That bodes well for the uber preppy West, but you never know — Usher’s romantic smoothie schtick is exactly the kind of thing that Grammy eats up. With eight nominations of, Usher’s “Confessions” might just knockout the cocky college dropout.
