# Stock 'Em or Rock 'Em: Sneaker Madness in Ottawa; Fans Camp Out to Buy Nike Air Yeezy IIs

They have been lined up on Rideau Street in Ottawa since Wednesday to buy a new sneaker designed by a rap musician. They have come from Toronto and from across the border.

They have no assurance they will find a pair in their size, but they were camping out for three nights, with rain forecast throughout.

“People think we’re stupid,” said Pryde Kirton, an 18-year-old Ottawa high school student. “But we’re not.”

More than just fans, he and his linemates are investors - and they figure to do quite well.

This morning, planet Earth will be home to the release of the Nike Air Yeezy II, designed by popular singer Kanye West.

“Armoured animalistic forms imbue the upper,” Nike’s website says of the shoe. “Hand-skived anaconda textured leather quarter panels are embellished with a debossed VacTech Nike Swoosh. The molded rear is sculpted with a reptilian-inspired spike.”

The people in line say they like the pictures they’ve seen of it - West and fellow rapper Jay-Z, among other stars, has been wearing the shoes in public for months - but that’s largely beside the point. The draw for them is that only about 3,000 pairs will be released to the public, worldwide, ever.

Unlike fans of Harry Potter or Apple, who camp out to get first crack at products the rest of the world will have a day later, this is a less-sentimental crowd.

Exclusive, limited-edition shoes are part of a sneaker culture that can bring their buyers respect and resale profits, while helping bolster the brand power of a company such as Nike.

The Ottawa store NRML is one of only six shops in Canada, that will sell the Yeezy II. And unlike Nike Town in Toronto, which is using a Twitter RSVP process to award the rights to buy a pair of the shoes, NRML is offering them first-come, first-served.

Naj Peterson, spokesman for NRML, said the store will have extra security on hand today to ensure there is no rioting, which has been a problem at some sneaker launches in the United States.

Pascal Tremblay was in line, hoping to buy a pair for hundreds of dollars and to sell it for thousands. The suggested Canadian retail price for the shoes is $299, and NRML is keeping secret the number of pairs the store has been allotted by Nike. Pairs of Air Yeezy IIs are already listed on eBay in the range of $3,000 to $7,000, however, and one especially rare preorder pair apparently sold for more than $90,000 on the auction site Wednesday.

Tremblay, a 21-year-old Bishops University finance student, and his business partner, Chief Bosompra, a 21-year-old communications major at Carleton University in Ottawa, were taking shifts to hold one spot in the line, entitling them to one pair of shoes.

They will buy, then wait awhile, then sell, with the help of a friend who has a perfect eBay rating.

“Our goal is five or six K,” Bosompra says.

Stephen Earl, a 19-year-old musician and DJ, said he was two days into a lineup in Toronto on Wednesday when Nike Town announced it was going to bypass the camp-out and go with the Twitter RSVPs. That’s when he rushed to Ottawa.

He says he’ll wear the shoes and eventually sell them, like he did with his Yeezy I shoes. For those, he camped out three times - once for the release of each of that shoe’s different styles or “colourways.” He wore them for a year, then sold them, bringing in about $900 for each of the used pairs. Camping out this week was an easy decision.

“It’s a way of securing an investment. It’s like art. You’re getting a really limited piece of art. You can sit on it, you can sell it right away, you can wear it.”

When you do wear them, Earl said, you turn a lot of heads - and sharply. The term for it is “neckbreaking,” he said. And a lot of people pay their respects.

Winston (Chino) Ho-Sang drove to the Ottawa stakeout with three friends from Paterson, N.J.

The 31-year-old Footlocker employee has been collecting hardtoget sneakers since the late 1990s: The LeBron South Beach; the Dinosaur Jr.; The Mork and Mindy, among many others.

He said he found NRML on a visit to Ottawa six years ago and was surprised to see merchandise on the shelves that gets snapped up right away in New Jersey, where sneaker culture is much more established.

“When I walked inside, they basically had gems, jewels and everything Godly around when it comes to the sneaker life,” Ho-Sang said.

Ho-Sang said that, until recently, he wouldn’t have thought of flipping the shoes for money. It’s less respectable to “stock ‘em” than to “rock ‘em,” he said.
