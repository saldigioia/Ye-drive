# Kanye West Nude Photos Hit the Web: Rapper Exposes Himself in Leaked Self-Taken Pictures

## The Debate as to Whether Kanye West Is One of the Biggest Music Stars in Pop Culture Has a Whole New Layer to It Now.

The debate as to whether Kanye West is one of the biggest music stars in pop culture has a whole new layer to it now that a nude photo of the rapper has hit the Web.

The website MediaTakeOut.com posted the image Friday, after weeks of rumors that claimed naked shots of West were making the rounds.

In the picture, which the site claims they received Friday morning, West is shown sitting on what appears to be a couch or chair, shirtless and wearing sunglasses and a chain necklace.

The bottom half of the uncensored photo, posted as a separate image, reveals West wearing black boxer-briefs with his member exposed.

According to RadarOnline.com, the “self-snapped” photos, which the site accurately described earlier this month, were “sent to a number of women, and are now for sale and being shopped to various media outlets.”

A source told the site, “These pics have been floating around since he hit so many girls up on MySpace. He probably sent them to many, many women.”

Though West, 33, has yet to comment on the leak, he’s no stranger to nude controversies.

The original artwork for his upcoming album, “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” was – as the rapper claimed – “banned” for featuring a naked woman, with bird-like features, in a sexual position with a male, possibly a visual representation of West himself.

“They don’t want me chilling on the couch with my phoenix!” he complained on Twitter.

He later offered a tongue-in-cheek apology, writing “I’m deeply sorry if I haven’t offended everybody.”

And earlier this week, West revealed his music video/short film “Runaway,” where his “phoenix” came to life, so to speak.

Model Selita Ebanks is partially naked in the 30-minute piece, with nude-colored feathers covering her private areas, and the two appear to have sex in one of the scenes.
