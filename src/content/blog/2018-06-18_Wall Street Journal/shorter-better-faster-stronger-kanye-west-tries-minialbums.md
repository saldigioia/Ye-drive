# Shorter, Better, Faster, Stronger? Kanye West Tries Minialbums

## While Many Musicians Are Releasing Bigger Albums With More Songs, the Rapper Is Working on Seven-Song Projects 

Kanye West is betting that good things can come from small packages.

The 41-year-old rapper has produced five albums, each with seven tracks, many under three minutes. Released on consecutive Fridays, mostly by his record label, G.O.O.D. Music, and its partner Def Jam Recordings, the minialbums are making waves in a music industry where bigger has increasingly been seen as better.

Mr. West scored his eighth No. 1 album with “Ye,” which was released on June 1 and lasts about 20 minutes in total. A week later, “Kids See Ghosts,” a miniproject with his one-time protégé Kid Cudi, came out and hit No. 2 on the latest Billboard album chart. (“Ye” is now No. 5.) Veteran emcees Pusha T and Nas also have recently dropped seven-song albums produced by Mr. West. A fifth album, from R&B singer Teyana Taylor, arrives Friday.

On the June 16 Billboard Artist 100 chart, which was announced last Wednesday and tracks artists’ weekly U.S. popularity through album sales, radio plays, streaming and social media, Mr. West ranked No. 1 for the first time.

“If this is a small thing, it definitely made a big impact,” says Jonathan Azu, artist-management executive at Red Light Management, whose clients include the hip-hop act Lecrae and R&B singer-songwriter Emily King. “They are dominating [the album-release calendar], and everyone’s talking about it.”

G.O.O.D. Music’s experiment is the latest instance of labels and artists tinkering with release strategies in the streaming age. Streaming is now the most popular way Americans listen to music. As listening habits change, record executives and musicians are trying to figure out how to reach fans and distinguish their releases in an increasingly crowded market.

Beyoncé and her husband, Jay-Z, released a surprise nine-song collaborative album Saturday night—repeating a strategy the pop star used for her self-titled 2013 album, which popularized surprise releases.

“Everything Is Love” was initially available only on Tidal, which could help prop up the music-streaming service. Tidal, partly owned by Beyoncé and Jay-Z, has struggled to compete against Spotify, the global leader among services by paying subscribers, and Apple Music. Streaming figures weren’t available.

Yet such exclusives have been criticized by some artists and music executives, since they limit a new release’s audience, and many in the industry have moved away from them. As of Monday morning, “Everything Is Love” was available on other services, including Spotify’s paid subscription tier—though not its free, ad-supported version.

Artists also are toying with album length and frequency of releases.

Hip-hop stars Migos and Rae Sremmurd are making lengthy albums with up to 27 tracks—a move that some critics say games streaming metrics. Every time a song is streamed, an artist earns royalties. More songs can mean more streams. And since late 2014, streams have been factored into the consumption numbers that drive Billboard chart rankings for albums.

Rappers Cardi B and Post Malone pump out singles on a consistent basis, while DJ duo the Chainsmokers has been releasing a new song every month since January. Philadelphia rapper Tierra Whack’s new album is 15 tracks and 15 minutes long.

Similar to how Mr. West’s provocative tweets and interviews in recent months helped him break through the clutter of social media ahead of his new releases, his seven-track albums are generating buzz for G.O.O.D. Music, music-industry experts say.

“This is a way to make the album more impactful and more important,” says Ben Carter, a writer and data analyst for the music website CentralSauce.

It’s too soon to tell if shorter albums will trump longer ones in the streaming world. One positive sign for G.O.O.D. Music: On Spotify, songs from “Ye” and “Kids See Ghosts” are racking up similar numbers of streams. That suggests fans are digesting the albums whole instead of picking a few tracks and ignoring the rest, as can happen with bigger releases.

Bite-sized LPs may go down smoother for music fans inundated each week not just with music, but movies, videogames and social-media. Audience attention is fragmented, says Red Light Management’s Mr. Azu. By having just seven songs, “you’re playing into the attention span of this generation, which isn’t that long.”

Mr. West hasn’t detailed his strategy, but he hints at the idea of shorter tracks on “4th Dimension,” a 2½-minute song on “Kids See Ghosts.” The track samples “Someday,” by gospel singer Shirley Ann Lee, which includes the lines “you only want 2½ minutes if you can get it…three minutes maximum” and “when it get too many then they can’t remember it and then they lose interest.”

The rapper’s spokesman declined to comment.

Shorter albums don’t necessarily mean smaller streaming numbers, according to Mr. Carter. At the Journal’s request, he analyzed first-week-of-release consumption data for hip-hop and R&B albums that reached the top five on the Billboard 200 since 2017 and found that streams from services reporting to Billboard drove 42% of consumption for short albums (5 to 10 tracks) and 43% for long albums (20-plus tracks). For albums with 11 to 19 tracks, streaming fueled 55% of consumption.

In theory, minialbums could spur additional streams if fans put the album on repeat, or listen to the artist’s other work, music-industry experts say. Repetition, in turn, breeds familiarity and attachment.

Ilan Zechory, co-founder of Genius, a lyrics and music-information website, says the brevity of “Kids See Ghosts” has him pressing repeat.

“I really like it,” he says of Mr. West’s seven-song albums. “It feels very fresh to me.”
