# West's Concert Was Welcome Treat, but Only by About 3,000

Rap and hip-hop shows are few in Knoxville. When an urban act actually does make it to town, it seems like an event.

Kanye West, Fantasia and Keyshia Cole (also billed Common was missing from the program) appeared Sunday night at Thompson-Boling Arena. The enthusiastic crowd of approximately 3,000 was made up mostly of young blacks. It seemed a surprisingly low turnout for a multi-platinum-selling headliner.

Accompanied by two dancers and a taped music track, Cole opened the evening with a short set that seemed little more than a courtesy introduction. Don’t write Cole off, though. Brandy opened a bill in Knoxville similarly a year before her career took off.

“American Idol” winner Fantasia Barrino did a better job of warming up the crowd with the songs “Baby Mama,” “It’s All Good” and “Ain’t Gonna Beg,” along with surprising covers of Prince’s “Purple Rain” and Aerosmith’s “Dream On.” Sure, Fantasia oversings, but not nearly so bad as has become fashionable in the past decade. Her energy and enthusiasm easily won the audience over.

Rapper West took the stage at 9 p.m. to the tune of Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions’ “Move On Up,” which introduced the song “Touch the Sky.”

Making a rap show work in a huge hall can be a challenge. But West was up to the task. While many rap shows rely solely on a DJ and taped music, West’s stage was filled with actual musicians. A string section (four violins, two cellos and one harpist), a turn-_tablist/keyboardist and percussionist played behind screened boxes. Sometimes the musicians were only seen as atmospheric shadows and at other times they were totally obscured behind images and films projected on the screen. Two singers stood to the left of the stage while West paced in the main area.

While West was in line with a lot of rappers in the good-time party department (“The New Workout Plan” was an early highlight and “Gold Digger” is massively catchy because of a creatively sampled segment of Ray Charles’ “I Got A Woman”), he was less posturing than many popular acts. His Grammy-winning “Jesus Walks” (another highlight on Sunday) was both a standout by its subject matter, and in that West actually raps to a march.

His subject matter in general deviates from the norm. Rather than taking on a gangster guise, West raps about everyday subjects — sick grandmothers, nurturing mamas, lofty dreams and low expectations and that lousy low-paying job that you go to every morning. Just as important, West enunciates, meaning his words communicate as much as his beats.

Yet all was not well in the audio department. Poor amplification often gave the string section that fingernails-across-a-chalkboard resonance, and as the volume increased toward the end of the show, the overall sound turned muddy.

Still, West’s appearance was an event — and the sort of event that would be welcome more often.
