title: "What Other Rapper Could Go Toe-to-Toe With Hip-Hop's Bullet-Holy Gangsta General in a Capitalist Clash of the Titans—and Come Away With the Crown—then Have 40-Something Gay Men and Mothers-of-Three Rockin' Out in Venetian-Blind Shades on Ellen? Who Else Among Emcees Could Corner Jacob the Jeweler More Coolly Than Leonardo Di Caprio and Make Packed Stadiums Lose Their Shit to Modern Gospel About Jesus' Power Better Than Benny Hinn? And in an Age of Sponsorship-Savvy Rhymesters, What Other Hip-Hopper Could Catch the Censors Sleeping Long Enough to Spit Venom at No Less Than the \"Free-World Leader,\" and Still Have Enough Fire Left to Sizzle Mtv and Britney Spears in a Single Spazzmatic Meltdown? All While Celebrating Teddy Bears and Sporting Tight Green Jeans. I Thought He Told You: You Can't Tell Him Nothin'! but When It Comes to Mr. West Being the Best, Mr. West, of Course, Says It Best. Again and Again and Again...
what Are the Elements of a Great Live Show?
well, I Have the Unfair Advantage of Having Really Big Records. but to Combine That With the Performance Level of a [talib] Kweli or a Common, Two Artists That Don't Use Hypemen, and Mos Def, That Way You Can Just Go Free-For-All and Just Express Yourself, and Somehow Bring the Audience in and Let Them Know That This Is Something That They Will Only Get in Their Town, That It's not Just, \"ok, This Is What Everybody Gets, Every Show.\"... but I've Looked at Other People's Shows and Have Been Highly Disappointed at People Who You're Supposed to Love, and It's Like, \"damn, Why Are They Doin' That So Long? Aw, Man, I Wouldn't Have Did That. I Woulda Took It Here.\" and I'll Just Say, With My Show, and With My Album, With My Videos, Let Me Try to Do Right What I Felt Other People Did Wrong.
what Shows Did You See as a Shortie That Inspired You?
aw, the Fugees! the Fugees Is a Show That I Saw. You Know There's Only a Few Artists Who Are Really Good Hip-Hop Performers. Like, Great Live Performers Isn't a Common Thing With Rappers. So My Performance, I'm not Even Really Trying to Compete With Other Hip-Hop Performers at This Point; I Was Starting Off. That's not to Say That I've Surpassed Them, but It's Just to Say That I'm not Even Thinking About That. I'm Thinking About What Is the Best Possible Show. So in the Back of My Mind, I'm Thinking About the Same Thing That Bono Thinks About, and That's Vegas, *the O Show*, Stuff Like That. It's Better Than Any Possible Thing You Could Do at a Rock Concert. and I Say Rock Because I Feel Whenever Any Form of Music Is at Its Highest Connection With the Fans and the Energy of the Crowd, at That Point, It Becomes Rock Because You're Rocking the Crowd Like That. So, Like 50 Cent at His Height: \"what Up, Blood? What Up, Gangsta?\" That's Like Straight Rock, and You Look in the Audience and People Are Vibing Out to It. or Like Daft Punk This Last Summer on Their Tour: That Was Straight Rock, Even Though It's, Like, Dance or Has This Classification. So When You See Me, and I'm Doing \"touch the Sky,\" You Know That's Curtis Mayfield, That's Like the Blackest Sample You Could Possibly Have, but That's Straight Rock the Way People Are Rockin'.
what Inspired Your Late Orchestration Show?
i'm Always Gonna Be Hip-Hop, but I Never Let It Dictate Where I Could Go. Where I Came from in Hip-Hop, It Was Always Like Ceilings. It Was Always Stuff That You Weren't Supposed to Do in Hip-Hop, 'cause Then It Made It Like It Wasn't Hip-Hop Anymore, or It Wasn't Cool Anymore. but the Thing Is, For Me, It's Like People, They Wanna Talk Shit, or They Wanna Try to Say His Music Is This, His Music Is That. but They Know I Got Too Much Credibility on the Rap Side, and on the Beat Side, and Too Many Years Doing Beats For Mos Def and Kweli and Common. So If I Drop a Joint Like \"stronger,\" They Realize It Still Has the Hip-Hop Elements in It. Sometimes the Average Rapper Will Do a Record Like \"stronger,\" and They're not That Concerned About the Lyrics Being What They Need to Be Because They Know It's Gonna Connect in This Way. but For Me, I Rewrote \"stronger\" Seven Times, Like I Was Writing Like I Was About to Be on a Kweli Song, 'cause I Still Wanted to Have That Respect Over Here. I Want Every Record to Be All Things to All People. So Comin' from Hip-Hop, I Just Don't Let It Be a Glass Ceiling to Me. When People Say That Ain't Hip-Hop or Whatever, Everything I Do at the End of the Day Is Gonna Be Hip-Hop Because I Am Hip-Hop. Everything I Do Is Gonna Be Black, a Black Version of Whatever That Is. I Think I'm Doing a Little Bit of What Elvis Presley Might Have Did to Black Artists: Elvis Might’ve Took Little Elements of Things That Made Black Artists So Hot and Applied It to His Thing. That's What I Do: I Take Stuff That I See With White Artists and Apply It to My Thing, from Coldplay or Uz or the Rolling Stones' Stage Show, to Some of the Tempos That Justice or Groups Like That or Black Eyed Peas Might Mess With, to Some of the Visuals of Bjork or Madonna.
what Is the Most Played-Out Thing to Do at a Hip-Hop Show?
too Many Hypemen. I Wanna Hear You. I Saw This Performance I'm not Gonna Say Anybody's Name—but They Had Their Hypeman Doin' Every Other Line, and the Hypeman Had a Really Bad Voice, and I Don't Like That Person's Voice. If You Like an Artist, You Like Their Voice. If You Like Common, You Like to Hear His Voice; You Like Lil Wayne, You Wanna Hear His Voice; T.i.; Me, You Wanna Hear My Voice. So at the End of the Day, You Go to the Show, My Show, We Up There For an Hour and 10, an Hour and 20 Minutes, and You're Hearin' My Voice For the Whole Time.
what's the Craziest Thing You've Had Happen Onstage?
just the Other Day My Pants Ripped All the Way Down While I Was Performing, and It Was Like, Man, That Shit Was Crazy... It Was Right Before I Did Big Songs, Too, Like \"gold Digger\" and \"good Life,\" So I Had to Perform Through It. and I Kinda Just Stood in a Place to Try to not Let It Be Too Noticeable.
on “barry Bonds,” You Claim “top Five Mcs.” Who Are the Other Four?
wayne Is the First Person That Comes to My Mind. Mos Def. There's a Few People That Come to Mind. but For Me, I Can't Say That I Am Particularly the No. 1 at Any Specific Thing, and I'm not Just Saying Hip-Hop, but Just in, Like, Music and Pop Culture. I Was Gonna Say, Maybe I'm the No. 1 For Being Vocal or Expressive, or No. 1 With Dealing With Backlash and Still Bein' Like, \"fuck It.\" You Try to Call Me a Fag, and the Next Day I Still Got on Tight Jeans, So Now What You Gonna Say to Me? I Didn't Adjust to What You Think I'm Supposed to Be Because of Hip-Hop. but as Far as Straight-Up Skill Levels, Obviously T.i. and Lil Wayne. and If You Take It Back to Method Man and Busta, Obviously, They're More Natural Emcees Than Me; They're Just More Fluid on the Beat and Shit. So I Can Have Bigger Records and Everything, but T.i. Can Still Think of These Fuckin' Raps in Three Minutes and Lay 'em Down, Like the Same Thing That Jay Does. Common's Voice--It's Like You Can Get More Used to My Voice or Whatever, but Pure Rap Voice, Common's Voice Is Better. Busta's Voice Is Better. Timbaland, His Sonics Just Knock. His Beats Knock Better Than My Beats. Dre's Beats Just Knock Better Than My Beats. It Is What It Is. but I'm Just the Top Five of Every Category.
i'm in the Top Five, Top Three, Top Two, Whatever, of Every Single Category, and That's What Makes Me the No. 1 of Everything
what Was Harder: Saying What You Did After Katrina, or What Came as a Result of Saying It?
that Was Just an Emotional Thing. We Just Gotta Work Past It. I Might not Have Got Whatever Types of Sponsorships, and People Are Scared of Me, and I'm Scary and I'm Controversial, but on the Other End, I Get to Do a Lot of Shows. and When I Rap and I Say You Can’t Tell Me Nothin’, You Believe Me. It's a Give-and-Take. It's Like With Any Artist. Like, an Artist Might Be a Gangsta Rapper, and They Have to Deal With All the Legal Stuff, and They Might not Be Able to Make It Into This Country or That Country. but on the Other End, You Believe What They're Saying Because That's Who They Really Are... People Have This Whole Thing Like, \"oh, He's Arrogant and Blah, Blah, Blah.\" but at the End of the Day, You Believe in What I'm Saying, and That's What's More Important. Like If Some Dude That's Just the Nicest Guy in the World Comes in and Raps and Shit, He's Like, \"yo, I'm the Best.\" You're Like, \"are You the Best? I Don't Even Believe That You Believe That.\" but You Believe That I Believe What I'm Sayin’. Man, I Believe My Own Hype. Believe Me. That Was Just an Emotional Thing. We Just Gotta Work Past It. I Might not Have Got Whatever Types of Sponsorships, and People Are Scared of Me, and I'm Scary and I'm Controversial, but on the Other End, I Get to Do a Lot of Shows. and When I Rap and I Say You Can’t Tell Me Nothin’, You Believe Me.

I Don't Even Believe That You Believe That.\" but You Believe That I Believe What I'm Sayin’. Man, I Believe My Own Hype. Believe Me."

What other rapper could go toe-to-toe with hip-hop's bullet-holy gangsta general in a capitalist clash of the titans—and come away with the crown—then have 40-something gay men and mothers-of-three rockin' out in Venetian-blind shades on Ellen? Who else among emcees could corner Jacob the Jeweler more coolly than Leonardo DiCaprio and make packed stadiums lose their shit to modern gospel about Jesus' power better than Benny Hinn? And in an age of sponsorship-savvy rhymesters, what other hip-hopper could catch the censors sleeping long enough to spit venom at no less than the "free-world leader," and still have enough fire left to sizzle MTV and Britney Spears in a single spazzmatic meltdown? All while celebrating teddy bears and sporting tight green jeans. I thought he told you: you can't tell him nothin'! But when it comes to Mr. West being the best, Mr. West, of course, says it best.

But I've looked at other people's shows and have been highly disappointed at people who you're supposed to love, and it's like, "Damn, why are they doin' that so long? Aw, man, I wouldn't have did that. I woulda took it here." And I'll just say, with my show, and with my album, with my videos, let me try to do right what I felt other people did wrong.

But on the other end, you believe what they're saying because that's who they really are... People have this whole thing like, "Oh, he's arrogant and blah, blah, blah." But at the end of the day, you believe in what I'm saying, and that's what's more important. Like if some dude that's just the nicest guy in the world comes in and raps and shit, he's like, "Yo, I'm the best." You're like, "Are you the best? I don't even believe that you believe that." But you believe that I believe what I'm sayin’. Man, I believe my own hype. Believe me. That was just an emotional thing. We just gotta work past it.
