# With a Little Help From Jay-Z, Kanye West Can "Touch the Sky"

The crowd at Madison Square Garden Nov. 3 was a mix of all types of folks. B-boys wearing varying shades of sport blazers and light blue jeans sat next to blonde chicks with popped collars. Forty-year-old couples out to try something new found themselves in the company of aspiring young performers and high school sophomores who listen to hip-hop albums on repeat in their mother’s cars.

This was the audience about to experience Kanye West’s “Touch the Sky” tour, about to become part of one of the greatest hip-hop shows New York City had ever seen.

Since his debut release, “College Dropout,” and his sophomore album, “Late Registration,” West has made quite a name for himself. From his daring political statements in songs like “Heard ‘Em Say” and “Crack Music” to his flashy outfits and signature aviators, this 27-year old rapper and producer from Chicago was someone that would not be ignored. Would his live performance justify his superstar status?

The concert started out fairly slow with performances from newcomer Keisha Cole along with American Idol participant Fantasia Barrino. Both women had strong vocals and promising stage presence, but the crowd did not seem to be that interested.

But anticipation and excitement breathed down the necks of all those seated in the theater when the stage lights dimmed. The crowd roared with gratitude and praise as Kanye West took the stage. Stepping out in a powder-blue blazer and white aviator sunglasses, West opened the show with the tour headliner, and hit single, “Touch the Sky.”

West mixed the play list with songs from both albums while utilizing graphic effects, laser lighting and an orchestra of strings and live vocals. He sung a range of songs from light-hearted joints like “The New Workout Plan,” or the ever-popular “Gold Digger,” to more serious songs like “Roses,” and “We Major” that touched on the topics of death and racism.

Many members of the crowd were disappointed to find out that fellow rapper, Common, would not be headlining the tour as was planned. But West would not leave his fans discouraged.

Halfway through the show, the lights dimmed once again, and West fled from the stage. The entire crowd began to scream “Encore!” In a few moments, Kanye returned with world-renowned hip-hop artist and rap legend, Jay-Z.

The intensity of the crowd grew ten-fold. Kanye looked on in awe as his audience showed appreciation for the man who had taken interest in West’s career just a few years earlier by signing him on to the Roc-A-Fella label.

After Jay-Z finished his performance, West once again grabbed the spotlight and proved that he was truly worthy of all the recognition he has received over the last two years. West delivered one of the most powerful performances ever when he had the entire theater screaming “Jesus Walks,” lyrics from one of his first hit singles.

West had the whole crowd standing from the first moment he put the mic to his mouth to his final bow. His performance was truly phenomenal and it is no small wonder that he was able to “touch the sky,” inspiring others to believe in themselves unconditionally and do the same. West’s show gave a message of hope and determination to the crowd that sat before him. He is certainly a performer that society will continue to hear from, whether it be politically or artistically, for years to come.
