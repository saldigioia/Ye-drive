# Kanye Suspends 'G.O.O.D. Friday' Series After 'Lost in the World' Leak

## ‘It's Messed Up That One Hacker Can Mess Everything Up,' He Says.

Way to go, hackers — now you've gone and messed up a G.O.O.D. thing.

Kanye West has decided to suspend his "G.O.O.D. Fridays" series — in which he planned to provide fresh tracks every week through Christmas — for one week after a track from his forthcoming album, the Bon Iver-sampling "Lost in the World," hit the Internet on Wednesday (September 29).

"Due to blogs leaking unfinished songs from my actual album I've decided to pass of Good Fridays this week," West tweeted late Wednesday. He continued: "It's messed up that one hacker can mess everything up for everyone ... I love to take a year to finish my songs and deliver them to you guys in there most completed form.

"It would have seemed like since I give free music every week even the lowest form of human being would respect that enough not to leak unfinished songs from my real album," an agitated West added.

While West did not specify what had set him off, it appears that the leak of "Lost" angered him. The haunting song samples folkie Bon Iver's "Woods" and includes lyrics from legendary urban poet/musician Gil Scott-Heron. The song is the third from the rapper's still-untitled upcoming album to make its way online, following the rousing "Power," which surfaced in May, and the sardonic "Runaway," which 'Ye premiered during the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards.

Earlier, West had agonized over his inability to decide on a title for the album. He is also still contemplating its release date, which is rumored to be November 22. "I'm finished with it, but when should I drop?" he asked. Although there are still a few finishing touches to be made: He later added that four engineers are mixing the album so it can be finished as soon as possible, and he's talked about corralling some guests.

"In the lab with Soulja Boy and Cudi," he wrote early Thursday morning. "2 of my favorite most genius artist. Even in my disappointment about the leaks I feel blessed."
