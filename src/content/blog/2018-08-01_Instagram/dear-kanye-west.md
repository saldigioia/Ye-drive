# Dear Kanye West

dear kanye west,

thank u for making my childhood dreams come true. the 14 year old in me is crying tears of joy right now. i remember leaving my grandmothers house in east orange new jersey back home to virginia and seeing a man on the side of the road selling bootleg copies of the college dropout... i went home and listened to it so much that it became so scratched i couldn’t even play it... i looked up every single sample on the album and spent months trying to recreate the beats... i dipped every single opened drum hit and made a “kanye west kit” and used them in every track i did for years... “last call” gave every young kid not doing shit the hope to keep going... i used to blast “spaceship” lines doing 5 beats a day for 3 summers... as my mantra... kanye not only did u shape me but u shaped every contemporary producer out now whether they like to believe it or not. u r the definition of a legend. thank you. also thank u to francis for believing in me enough to bring me on this wave.
