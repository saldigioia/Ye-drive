# Kickin' It With Kanye

## Retailers Expecting Rush for Rapper's Nike Air Yeezy

When a shoe gets thrown, it’s a sign of disrespect.

When a shoe drops, however, it’s a massive fashion moment.

At least that’s the case with the Nike Air Yeezy, the limited-edition sneaker designed by Kanye West. The first colorway comes out Saturday, and the shoe has generated considerable buzz inside and outside the sneaker collector community.

It’ll be available only at select locations, and in Chicago those stores are expecting a rush.

No previous shoe release has garnered the anticipation surrounding the Air Yeezy, according to Krabieh Ranopolout (a.k.a. Krabby Rangoon), manager of Saint Alfred, 1531 N. Milwaukee. The Wicker Park store planned a special release event beginning at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.

Why the anticipation? Rangoon thought the desire could be because it’s a milestone of sorts for hip-hop: While rappers have had shoes before, none has been with a brand so established as Nike. West’s seemingly limitless gifts for self-promotion and aesthetic influence — remember the outbreak of Venetian-blind sunglasses? — have no doubt helped.

“Love him or hate him, Kanye is definitely an influence across genres,” Rangoon said. “He has the ability to affect a lot of things, whether it be fashion, music or even vocabulary.”

To get your Yeezys on, you’ll have to pay a sticker price of $215, possibly more if a store decides to mark them up. But that price isn’t putting people off.

On eBay, some pairs are selling for more than $500. And Ben Miller, a sales associate at Self-Conscious, 1021 W. Lake, said the shop has been getting offers from people offering to pay double if the store would hold a size. Miller said the store is releasing the shoe at 11 a.m. Saturday, and people will have to show up and take their chances.

That people would make these offers and be willing to wait in line may seem strange, especially in a lousy economy, but Miller said that like other big collector cultures, sneakers have a certain draw.

“With sneakers, it’s never really affected — maybe like the sneakers at the mall, maybe that might be hit by the economy,” he said. “But at boutiques and with high-end shoes, it’s always going to sell.”
