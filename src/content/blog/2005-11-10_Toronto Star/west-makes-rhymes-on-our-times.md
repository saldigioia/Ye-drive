# West Makes Rhymes on Our Times

Kanye West is not one of those artists who claim not to read reviews or pay attention to critics.

Towards the end of last night’s not-quite-capacity show at the Air Canada Centre, the producer turned Grammy-winning rapper sat centre stage as an overhead screen scrolled excerpts of his negative press.

The quotes from media outlets such as Spin magazine and the Boston Globe labelled him “narcissistic,” “egotistical” and “obnoxious” - typical of circulating opinion that the Chicago MC is an overrated sore loser and loudmouth.

Afterwards, clad in all-white slacks, blazer and sunglasses, the 28-year-old rhymer stood with his back to the audience, arms out, lapping up their adoration and reinforcing that idea that he may be imbued with a messianic complex - as in the interview where he referred to himself as the “ghetto pope.”

That’s unfortunate, because his work speaks for itself his current hit “Gold Digger” from Late Registration has held the No. 1 spot on Billboard’s Hot 100 singles and Hot Ringtones charts for 10 weeks. And it’s been No. 1 on the Pop 100 for eight weeks.

And the 7,000 who attended last night’s concert - his first headlining stadium gig in Toronto after opening for Usher and cramming The Docks - were on their feet, dancing and singing along, for the entire 90-minute set, even during the overly saccharine “Hey Mama” which he dubbed “my little emotional segment of the show.”

Exactly halfway through his two-month Touch the Sky Tour, West was energetic and playful as he delivered the songs which have marked him as the connector between socially conscious rap and its booty-shaking cousin. Backed by a keyboard player, percussionist, seven-woman string section, two back-up singers, and Quebec’s DJ A-Trak, he offered little in the way of gimmicks. His dance moves amount to erratic shadow boxing and snapping his head sideways. But this audience was keen on his recitations about politics, spirituality, materialism and family values, with an admonishment to “live every day like it’s your last.”

It’s ironic, really, that the most recent criticism of this college professor’s son - who survived a 2002 car accident that broke his jaw in three places and who had early difficulty winning a recording contract because of his middle class background - has come from former crack dealer 50 Cent. The gansta’ rapper defended George W. Bush after West’s infamous ad-lib at a Katrina benefit that Bush “doesn’t care about black people.”

Diligently pushing his new biopic, 50 is being lauded for applying the work ethic of his drug dealing past to push menacing, sexist songs. West is being taken to task for trying too hard for critical respect, for taking musical risks and for having healthy self-esteem.

There are worse problems, especially in hip hop.
