# Kanye West Debuts New Disc

Kanye West unveiled his fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak, in Los Angeles on October 14th. “It’s time to deliver ideas in the most naked form possible,” West told the 700 guests, who heard the new record while gazing at an installation of nude women and colored lights by Italian artist Vanessa Beecroft. Due out November 25th, the record features very little rapping. Instead, West sings about pain and loss in songs with titles like “Love Lockdown” and “Heartless.” West noted that “Cold As Winter” was written about his mother, who died last year following complications from cosmetic surgery. “These are pieces of real life that I’m put- ting out for people to judge,” West said. “It’s from my heart. I don’t give a fuck if someone rates it ‘hot’ or “not.’ It’s talk- ing about things people really go through.”
