# “Clique”

By most standards, Jay-Z and Kanye West are having a good year. G.O.O.D. Music's surprise appearance at the "Made In America" festival in Philly meant there were guests of a slightly higher caliber than, say, Freeway, and "Way Too Cold" and "Mercy" have reached a level of ubiquity to assure the commercial success of Cruel Summer. But when compared to center-of-the-universe type shit like "POWER", or "Niggas in Paris", or even "Empire State of Mind", hasn't it all felt...a little minor?

Fortunately, "Clique" is finally the kind of track you'd expect from people who (technically) just kicked it with the leader of the free world. As with "Niggas in Paris," Hit-Boy's chromed-out beat creates an instant impression. Big Sean spits some goofy punchlines ("My block behind me like I'm pulling out the driveway!") and then disappears. Jay-Z calmly explains to you for the thousandth time how you are not on his level, and it's like watching Superman triumph once again-- wholly expected, sorta comforting.

But for a track that's ostensibly a posse cut on a posse record, "Clique" becomes a platform for Kanye to talk his shit again-- he stunts on George Tenet, buys property next to TC (that's Tom Cruise), meditates in Pompeii, empathizes with his girlfriend ("my girl a superstar all from a home movie"), and mourns for his dead mother. Somehow, he makes it all seem relatable and humane, even though he's calling himself a vessel for God's words by the end. Is "Clique" center of the universe-type shit? At the very least, Kanye and Jay are the center of attention, and all feels right with the universe as a result.
