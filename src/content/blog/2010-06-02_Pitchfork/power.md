# “Power”

Obama called him a jackass. A nation booed him. Fucking Jay Leno almost made him cry on TV. Just when it seemed like Kanye West was ready to go into hip-hop overdrive after that 808s detour-- check the astounding pre-Imma-Gate run of guest shots for proof-- he was banished. Or, perhaps more accurately, he banished himself. No potentially head-expanding tour with Gaga. No new verses. Almost nothing but art-school models wearing next to nothing on the blog. Kanye was gone for eight months. The Eyjafjallajökull-style lighting plume that is "POWER" makes it sound like he was trapped in a cardboard box for eight years. And now he's got something to say.

Of course he responded with King Crimson's "21st Century Schizoid Man"-- a song about a future maniac who has it all but "nothing he's got he really needs." It's a common existential gripe for the larger-than-life set. More than ever, though, "POWER" has Kanye internalizing his multiple minds and coming to an ecstatic peace with them. "POWER" is not a bitchfest. It's an exaltation. All of his various guises-- King of the Assholes, drama queen, Red Bull'd 12-year-old, Next Chappelle, strangely relatable Megaman-- are mashed up in this proudly schizoid roll call. Every sound is ready for the arena, and every couplet is ready for the 140 character treatment, including this one: "I don't need yo pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick/ I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?" He knows the answer, and so do we.
