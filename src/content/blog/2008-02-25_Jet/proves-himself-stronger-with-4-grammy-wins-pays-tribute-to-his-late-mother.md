# Proves Himself ‘Stronger’ With 4 Grammy Wins; Pays Tribute to His Late Mother

Kanye West is noted for making a lasting impression with his appearances at the Grammy Awards. This year was no different during what is considered music's biggest night.

The rap star, who was a leading nominee with eight nominations, walked away with four Grammy Awards and stirred up an emotional high during a heart-rending tribute to his late mother, Dr. Donda West.

Before the show was televised at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, Kanye West was a multiple winner with awards for Best Rap Solo Performance for Stronger, Best Rap Performance By A Duo or Group with Common for Southside; and a songwriter's honor for Best Rap Song for Good Life, which features T-Pain.

West, wearing glow-in-the-dark glasses, captivated the audience with a mellow version of Stronger, which featured a special appearance by Daft Punk, the Parisian techno duo who made its first-ever TV appearance in their 14year career. The group worked with West to put together a new rendition especially for the show. West, who had the word "MAMA" shaved into the back of his head, paid tribute to his late mother by performing a rousing rendition of Hey Mama as an image of an angel was shown behind him.

"Last night I saw you in my dreams. Now I can't wait to go to sleep," he sang before beginning the song's rap. He ended the song by solemnly saying, "This life is all a dream. My real life begins when I go to sleep." The audience gave him a standing ovation.

A short while later West walked away with his fourth Grammy of the evening in the Best Rap Album category for Graduation. He gave his first televised remarks since his mother's death in November (Jet, Nov. 26,2007).

"I appreciate everything and I know you're proud of me right now and I know you wouldn't want me to stop and you'd want me to be the No. 1 artist in the world. And Mama, all I'm going to do is keep making you proud. We run this."

Donda West, who often accompanied her son to the Grammy Awards and even once performed with him on the show, died of heart disease and multiple postoperative factors after plastic surgery (Jet, Jan. 28).

T-Pain, who lends his vocal abilities to West's Good Life, said he enjoyed collaborating with the hard-working performer. "I was sweating from dancing in the studio. It felt good. It's love. You can't explain love. It's a fantastic feeling." TPain also complimented West's selfassurance in the past. "I love his arrogance. [A] couple more of these and 111 be like that too."

This year marked the 50th anniversary of the Grammys, and history was made when Herbie Hancock became the first Black jazz musician to win Album of the Year. "That's unbelievable man," said music producer Quincy Jones as he and co-presenter Usher observed Hancock's surprise win for River: The Joni Letters, which was inspired by musician Joni Mitchell. The last time a jazz artist won in this category was in 1964 for Getz/Gilberto by Stan Getz and Joao Gilberto.

"I'd like to thank the academy for courageously breaking the mold this time," Hancock said. "This is a new day that proves that the impossible can be made possible. Yes we can, to coin a phrase," he added, referring to Barack Obama's presidential campaign slogan.

During the pre-telecast show, Hancock won Best Contemporary Jazz Album for River: The Joni Letters.

Highlights of the evening included a pairing of sexy-legged divas Tina Turner and Beyoncé for a couple of medleys before working the audience over with an electrifying performance of Proud Mary.

The reunion of the original members of The Time was another show-stopper. The group, who performed Jungle Love, had never appeared on the Grammys. Vibrant newcomer Rihanna joined the group to perform her hits Umbrella and Don't Stop The Music.

Time original member Jimmy Jam is now chairman of the board of trustees for The Recording Academy. Backstage, lead singer Morris Day playfully shared with reporters how he preserved his sex appeal. "The reason I'm still sexy is due to an active sex life," he said.

Rihanna later won in the Best Rap/Sung Collaboration category for Umbrella featuring her mentor, Jay-Z.

Royalty earned wins for the evening. The Queen of Soul Aretha Franklin and Queen of Hip-Hop Soul Mary J. Blige won for Never Gonna Break My Faith in the Best Gospel Performance category.

The regal duo tied The Clark Sisters in that category for their performance of Blessed & Highly Favored. The Clark Sisters also won Best Traditional Gospel Album for Live-One Last Time. It was the first album the sisters recorded together in more than a decade. Karen ClarkSheard won Best Gospel Song for Blessed & Highly Favored.

Two days before the Grammy Awards, Franklin was honored as the MusicCares Person of the Year for her accomplishments as an artist and humanitarian. A record $4.5 million dollars was raised during the MusicCares special tribute performance and dinner, according to Neil Portnow, president/ CEO of The Recording Academy. MusicCares' mission is to ensure that music people have a compassionate place to turn in times of need while focusing the resources and attention in the music industry on human services issues that directly impact the health and welfare of the music community.

Best R&B Duo/Group Performance With Vocals went to Chaka Khan and Mary J. Blige for Disrespectful. Khan also won Best R&B Album for Funk This.

"It's nice to be in the mix," Khan said backstage. "I'm honored. I'm blessed...I don't see this as competition but as people being appreciated."

Alicia Keys kicked off the show with a performance of Learnin' the Blues as archival footage of the late Frank Sinatra allowed her to do a duet with him. Prince, who presented an award after the performance, said, "Frank Sinatra looked good for 150, didn't he?" just before handing Keys a win for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for No One. Earlier in the day, Keys won for songwriting on No One in the Best R&B Song category.

Prince, dressed in all red, won Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for Future Baby Mama.

Ne-Yo won for Best Contemporary R&B Album for Because of You.

Best Traditional R&B Vocal Performance went to the late Gerald Levert for In My Songs. His teary-eyed mother, Martha, and brother, Sean, accepted in his honor. "Big G, rest in peace. We got one for you," said Sean, accepting the honor during the pre-telecast show. Backstage, Sean said his brother would have probably said, "It's about time," had he been alive to receive his first win. Levert died in 2006. (Jet, Nov. 6,2006).

In the category Best Urban/Alternative Performance, rapper Lupe Fiasco's Daydreamin', featuring Jill Scott, won. Fiasco's mother and sister, holding a publicity photo of Fiasco, accepted in his honor. Reportedly ill with pneumonia and the flu, they said, "pray for him as he recovers."

Barack Obama took home a Grammy for The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream in the Best Spoken Word Album category. Veteran songwriter/singer Siedah Garrett won Best Song Written for Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media for Love You I Do, originally performed by Jennifer Hudson, from the Dreamgirls soundtrack.

Best Contemporary R&B Gospel Album went to Fred Hammond's Free to Worship. Israel and New Breed won Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album for A Deeper Level. Stephen Marley won Best Reggae Album for Mind Control. The Soweto Gospel Choir won for African Spirit in the Best Traditional World Music Album category. Angelique Kidjo won Best Contemporary World Music Album for Djin Djin.

Patti Austin, who co-hosted the preGrammy telecast show, won Best Jazz Vocal Album for Avant Gershwin. Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album went to Terence Blanchard for A Tale of God's Will (A Requiem For Katrina). Pinetop Perkins was among the winners for Best Traditional Blues Album for Last of the Great Mississippi Delta Bluesmen: Live in Dallas. Others on that song included Henry James Townsend, Robert Lockwood Jr. and Honeyboy Edwards.

Special Merit Awards went to the late jazz singer and bandleader Cab Calloway and late jazz great Max Roach for Lifetime Achievement, while distinguished music executive Clarence Avant and music producer/arranger Willie Mitchell received Trustees Awards.
