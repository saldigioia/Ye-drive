# Pride (In the Name of Love)

## What's the Deal With Kanye? Misunderstood, Misrepresented? A Tortured Genius? Or All the Above?

### Kanye West Shocked Fans by Singing on His Controversial Album, 808s & Heartbreak. But He Says the Shocking Has Only Just Begun. In a Candid Interview With Sean Fennessey, West Unleashes on the Perils of Fame, the Problems of Love, and His Latest Moniker: The Human Hypebeast. Welcome to Heartbreak.

Kanye West is so tired of being Kanye West. On November 25, after a taping of Late Night With Conan O’Brien (NBC) — his fifth media event in two days — his chauffeured black. Chevy Tahoe is bombing down New York City’s Fifth Avenue dodging a swarm of fans chasing the vehicle, Beatles-style. Everyone inside the car is trying to ignore the paparazzo riding alongside on a bicycle, snapping photos on a small digital camera. And Mr. West is shot. Dark rings around his eyes, lids falling, full-bellied yawns slipping out. A whirlwind 48-hour tour, from the 2008 American Music Awards in L.A. to ABC’s Good Morning America in New York, is finally coming to a close, and as he sits slumped in a captain’s seat, silver Apple PowerBook on his lap, he’s doing something that relaxes him: blogging. There are pictures of alluring women on the screen, just waiting for his signature WHERE ARE YOU YEEZY??? word bubble.

Once the photographer has been thwarted (“I actually do like his music,” the pap blurts before politely being asked to bounce by a bodyguard) and the fans outrun — though one particularly vociferous teenager gets an autograph at a red light — the Tahoe will take him to John F. Kennedy Airport to board a Netherlands-bound plane, where he’ll continue his acclaimed Glow in the Dark Tour. This is his final interview before the trip. And he can’t finish it.

“There’s a balance in a great Kanye West interview,” he says, sliding the laptop into a camouflage Louis Vuitton carry-on and leaning back in his seat. “Politically incorrect shit that’s obvious that no one speaks on. Bold statements. A bit of heart. Inspiration. Aspiration. A bit of humor, in my opinion…”

He trails off. Kanye has just fallen asleep. Mid-sentence.

It’s hard to blame him. He has hurtled himself across the globe to deliver his fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak (Roc-A-Fella/Def Jam, 2008), to the world. And his body can’t take it anymore. It’s not an uncommon feeling for the 31-year-old Chicago native. Since his debut, 2004’s The College Dropout (Roc-A-Fella/Def Jam), West has been a relentless self- promoter, a petulant brat, a fascinating and dogged media personality, an innovative shaper of pop music, a style icon, and an honest-to-goodness superstar. His fame has grown exponentially, culminating in the pop extravaganza, Graduation (Roc-A-Fella/Def Jam), which sold nearly one million copies during its first week of release in 2007.

But 808s is something different, a sharp left turn in his expansive oeuvre. Recorded over three weeks in Hawaii in the aftermath of his mother Donda West’s 2007 death and last year’s breakup of his 20-month long engagement to fashion designer Alexis Phifer, the album is a broken man’s denouement, wringing loose emotional demons while coming to terms with his own decisions. He is singing throughout, mostly with the aid of Auto-Tune technology, something that has polarized his fans into virulent debate. And he sounds bitter. It’s a gutsy, if not perfect, piece of art. But he will not back down from his decisions. He says this is just the beginning, “the blueprint” for his musical future.

Kanye did finally complete this interview, from Hamburg, Germany, three days later. He was wide awake and vibrant, riffing on fame, love, women, God, and his desire to pose naked. He was typically perceptive, sometimes outrageous. He did not fall asleep once.

***

**VIBE: Do you remember the moment you knew you needed to do this project?**

**KANYE WEST:** About three songs in, I said, “I’m gonna do this.”

**Which three?**

“Heartless,” “Love Lockdown,” and “Bad News.”

**How did it start?**

I was just working on Jay’s album, and I was like, Okay, I’m gonna work on some shit for me. And I did the “In the night I hear ‘em talk, the coldest story ever told…”

**Was there any thought about giving “Heartless” to Jay?**

Jay’s got shit no one’s heard. We went back and forth on who’s gonna take which songs.

**Did you create this album as a form of therapy?**

I’ve heard that word a lot. Therapy. It wasn’t done as therapy. I guess it was done as therapy in the way anything is done as therapy. Playing basketball is therapy. Design is therapy, it’s being creative. Performing can be therapy. I did these songs just to be doing good music. So I don’t think it was any more therapeutic than playing basketball. But was it therapeutic? Yeah.

**You used to talk about being on a path, knowing your album titles and when you’re going to put them out. Are you still on that path?**

I knew that path, but I guess the obvious answer is no because I didn’t roll with the original fourth album title [Good-Ass Job. Life sometimes changes. I’m on a path that God puts me on. I don’t believe all of this happened by chance. I’m in the position that I’m in due to who my parents were, due to my attitude, and my taste, and my opinion. I used to drop albums and there was this big thing with me and the critics. I’m my own worst critic. You can’t find anything else wrong.

**Did the critics bother you because you were so hard on yourself?**

Yeah. And also, I didn’t realize at the time that my albums are open to criticism, which, at the end of the day, they are. These are gifts that I’m delivering the world. These aren’t term papers. These aren’t tests. With a song like “Diamonds,” it’s almost like I was trying to pass a test. Look how good I could rap, look how many instruments I could put on this, look at me and Jon Brion, watch us show off. And it’s not that the record wasn’t good, but when you make a record like “Love Lockdown,” it’s like you’re not even trying to pass a test. You just do a Basquiat painting over the whole test. And sure, every answer is wrong, but look, it makes a beautiful picture.

**Do you feel like you grew up and there are no more tests?**

Yeah. But you never have to take a test. That’s what other people need to realize. They’re not at the mercy of other people’s opinions. It’s all what you believe in yourself. Your attitude determines your latitude. Because a lot of people are gonna thought-project. They’re gonna tell you what you can and cannot do. Like, Aw, man, I wouldn’t be doing that. Well, that’s you. God has put me in a really good space. He has a mission for me. There’s gonna be ups and downs. But there’s something He wants me to deliver to the world. He knows I was going through some dark times…and He shed some light in my life.

**When you’re dealing with the paparazzi, do you feel like a violent person?**

I haven’t done anything violent. They make it seem like I actually went and hit paparazzi. I haven’t. I was restrained. I’m good at restraining myself from committing violent acts. I know how to control my temper. That one paparazzo made it a bigger deal. I just put my hand up, and he felt like he had more right to my personal space than I did. I put my hand up to stop him from shooting me.

**Is that what bothers you about stardom?**

The paparazzi? Even when I first dropped, paparazzi wasn’t as crazy. The law hasn’t caught up with the Internet. People are just taking advantage. People don’t realize we’re completely intruding on these people’s spaces and nobody’s saying anything, so let’s keep doing it. [Cigarettes] have a Surgeon General’s warning on it. We need a Surgeon General’s warning on some of those lens caps. Warning: Might completely intrude on your space, sabotage your image.

**The Internet has been instrumental in your career. Some people know you more for your blog than your music.**

I wish.

**Is it more valuable?**

In the future it could be. There’s times when I’ll feel frustrated or upset about something and I’ll just take a day off, but I’ll still put up some posts, and I’ll do my little rants. On tour it gives me something to do.

**Has music become easy for you?**

Music is easy for me, and it should be. I’m a professional now. Sometimes I zone out, completely Jordan out on a track. Like “Say You Will.” I did the beat in 10 minutes.

So where do you go from here, artistically? One of the hardest things about art is getting it paid for. It didn’t click in my mind until about a month ago that this whole time I’ve been releasing hit records to pay for art. You’re releasing hit records so the label believes in you enough to pay for the “Touch the Sky” video.

**The Glow in the Dark set was extravagant. Are you still touring to make money? Or are you content spending the gate on the tour itself?**

I don’t want to take a loss because touring is my livelihood. But I’ll definitely sacrifice. Maybe I’ll make half of what someone else will make. But I think I’ll make history at the same time. Or change people’s minds about hip hop culture, about black culture. And do something that people will remember for the rest of their lives. That’s more important than money. Of course, I want to be able to support myself, but maybe I’ll buy a little less jewelry, a few less cars, one less crib, or any of these things that celebrities buy — [all] in hopes of giving the fans the greatest experience possible. It’s so weird, I get a lot of flack. There’s people who honestly don’t like me. This is well-known, right? I just sit back and look at it like, Why? What did I actually do? Did I do something negative toward someone? If I made a mistake, did I not apologize for it and take it like a man? When I said, “I don’t listen to rap in my apartment,” the press took that comment and ran with it. Think about this: If that was the most negative comment they could find, imagine how positive the whole rest of the interview was. That’s not even a negative comment. That’s just saying in my apartment now I listen to Thom Yorke, or Róisín Murphy.

**Well, you have an album in which there’s less rapping than ever before. Some people took that comment to mean you don’t listen to rap at all and felt betrayed by that.**

When I worked on College Dropout, rap was way more exciting than it is now. At the end of the day, I’m a designer, I move with the sign of the times. I didn’t listen to any more rap when I was doing Graduation than I do now. It’s just out the closet that I don’t listen to a lot of rap now. Flisten to it, and I hear it, but I don’t have time to listen to it over and over. I couldn’t recite any rap. I can barely recite “A Milli,” and I’ve heard that a lot.

**There’s this idea in hip hop that it’s ours, and we have to protect it. You’re saying, I’m pop, and I want to be everything. Has it crossed your mind that this might piss people off?**

I’d rather piss a bunch of people off and make myself happy than make everyone else happy and be pissed off inside. I’m not a politician. I’m a musician. I’m an artist. At any given time, I’m gonna do what I wanna do when I wanna do it, and people can have their reasons why they don’t like something. But if they open their mind up for one second like, Wow, when I was 3 years old, did I have a problem with music that wasn’t rap music? Or did I just like it? Did I have a problem with a song by Boy George? Did I even know if Boy George is gay or not, or do I just like his song? But in hip hop, you say, Man, I think this dude is gay, so I’m not gonna like his song. People always don’t like something for some type of stupid reason. I don’t have to listen to rap. I am rap. I AM RAP! I am what people rap about. I actually rap for 30,000 people a night. I am a walking Hypebeast. I am like Hypebeast, the guy. I’m actually the human being version of a brand. I’m like Nike, the human being.

**You’ve got people scared though.**

Think about a designer. What if Raf Simons told you, “I don’t even look at fashion shows”? You wouldn’t wear a Raf Simons suit if he said he didn’t look at fashion shows? That’s the stupidest fucking thing ever! So if anybody said, I don’t wanna listen to Kanye even though he’s one of the best artists of our time and one of the best rappers of our time and one of the best musicians and entertainers of our time, I don’t wanna listen to Kanye because he said he doesn’t listen to rap in his apartment — I can’t be responsible for other people’s stupidity.

**What if somebody said, I don’t want to hear Kanye sing?**

Okay, cool.

**You’re fine with that?**

What am I supposed to do about that? Change what I wanna do?

**Are you concerned about the perception of 808s once it’s out of your system?**

What do you mean “out of my system”? This is the beginning of my system. Did you think it’s like, Well, Kanye’s got that out of his system, now he’s gonna go back to making songs that sound like some shit he made seven years ago?

**Not necessarily, but you’re an artist who’s always trying to change up.**

No, I don’t try. I do. There’s some people that try and then they get scared and then their shit ends up sounding like it sounded before. I’m the dude that says, Bam — 808s, taiko drums, and a whole bunch of lasers. This is what I’m going with. And I’m not waiting to see if someone likes it or not. This is what I’m putting out. I like it, it’s good, and it’s on you. I’m not a museum. I’m not here to be an archive of old concepts. I’m new. For all the kids who wear lumberjack shirts now and used to wear neon last year, this is the music they listen to. I make the soundtrack of our lives and who we are and who I am.

**Do you think that no matter what decisions you make with music, those kids wearing lumberjacks will roll with you?**

I can’t say what they would do. My end goal is actually to make popular music. I could state all day long, “I’m an artist.” But still, it’s an attempt to make something popular, that penetrates culture. Take a song like “Flashing Lights.” It didn’t do at radio what we thought it should have done, but then you see it on TV shows a year later. It’s like a pastor says something and then two years later you apply it to your life. Somehow it penetrated culture. And for all hip hop lovers and haters, are you really telling me “Love Lockdown” did not already penetrate culture and won’t be around 10 years from now, 20 years from now? It’s not gonna be on movie soundtracks and playing out of radios and stores? And when people gonna see it two years from now in concert, it’s not gonna be a festival killer? Is someone telling me that “Love Lockdown” doesn’t actually sound like the music we sample? I feel like on this album I reached another level of musical ability that can only be held back by samples. On this album, it’s just straight made from scratch.

**Is that somehow more authentic?**

It doesn’t feel any less authentic than if I was to sample. “Love Lockdown” is a musical triumph for me. It’s a song that plays on radio that has 72 bars of lyrics. I don’t think it’s any less hip hop than songs that have rapping on them. Why would people be so mad at my songs but be accepting of Mary J. Blige records back in the day? Are they not ready for it? Were people just ready to dis Auto-Tune? I put out “Love Lockdown” originally off-pitch to prove a point about life, about religion, about relationships. People always try to be so fucking perfect, and I think that there’s some beauty in imperfection. People should embrace their flaws. Right now it’s all about the perfect six-pack. The perfect outfit. The perfect pitch. And it’s like, Damn, your grandmother wasn’t perfect, but you still love her.

**Was putting the album out so quickly part of that?**

I could have put it out as a mixtape. I always wanted to do a mixtape called T-Pain Style. And I was like, if these songs are good as hell, why not put it out as a real album? And who’s to say what’s a mixtape, what’s an album? I ain’t have to drop an album either. What I do at this point is a gift. And I think people are complaining about their gift. They can either play with it or not! But don’t complain to me about the gift. There’s guys out there, nobody spoke on our behalf before. Whatever about the singing. Fuck all the singing, fuck the Auto-Tune, fuck the He’s a rapper, he’s not a rapper, he’s going through something, he has to get this out of his system, he’s crazy. Fuck all that. It’s men out there who have never had anyone to speak on their behalf about the way they feel in a relationship. We don’t feel like, Fuck you, bitch, I’m gonna just fuck a whole buncha girls. No! We feel hurt. We feel pain. Like, Damn, why would you say something like that to me? Damn, I LOVE YOU. Damn, I want to have a family. Damn, I want to find someone to raise my kids. Damn, my baby momma’s a bitch. Or she’s not a bitch. That more than anything — more than the way I wanted to deliver this art — is the message behind it. People used to complain that I had all this materialistic shit in my lyrics. There’s absolutely no materialism [on 8085]. The fact that [“Welcome to Heartbreak” ] says, “My friend show me pictures of his kids, and all I could show him was pictures of my cribs” …and people are like, But you used Auto-Tune. “Coldest Winter” doesn’t have Auto-Tune on it! People are so caught up in the packaging. If I had given this album to a “singer,” there wouldn’t have been any complaints about it. It’s not too different than the complaints people had about my rapping. And I blatantly rap better now than on The College Dropout. I am arguably one of the best rappers in the world.

**Why do you feel persecuted?**

Why do I feel like what’s happening is really happening?

**But where is this coming from?**

People will say it, or I’ll read it. They’ll say, I wish it was rap. But I told you it wasn’t. I braced myself for the backlash of people who are not ready for change.

**Is this your best album?**

I do think it’s my best album to date. No, I actually know this is my best album to date. Do I think it will be my best album ever? No. I’ll improve. Do I think there are mistakes in it? Yes. There has to be. I’m a human being. But I think it far surpasses Graduation. These 12 tracks are going to resonate more than any 12 tracks of any album this year.

**Even more than Tha Carter III?**

I’m not here to do a direct comparison. You know I love Wayne, so 1 would never speak on anything that can be misconstrued by some form of stupidity. That’s why I don’t have beef with no rappers. I don’t have beef with human beings, period. If anything, I might beef with the guy who brought my breakfast up an hour late at the hotel. A rapper or a musician, we have to inspire each other. And I think that different people have their advantages over others. I think T.I. has his advantages, I think Lil Wayne has his advantages, I think Jay-Z has his advantages, Jeezy has his advantages, I have my advantages. There’s no such thing as the end-all, be-all, perfect artist, but the imperfection is what represents the world. In the past, I’ve cried like a little bitch about shit that’s completely insignificant. The other side of that is people have seen my dedication to the music. I’m not here to speak on what any other artist is doing wrong. All I wanna speak is what someone else is doing right. The only person I want to speak negatively about is myself. I’m putting out positive energy. Right now in this day and age, we have a couple of amazing artists. I believe Beyoncé is the greatest performer of our generation. I believe I am the greatest entertainer of this generation. I go neck and neck on Jay-Z and Wayne as far as who’s the best lyricist. Jay-Z has longevity.

**Will the next thing you do musically be as distinctly different as this?**

This is the blueprint for the future.

**We talked about music as therapy. Did you ever consider actual therapy after your mom passed away?**

I don’t believe in therapy. I believe in you gotta walk it out, you gotta live it out. Life has its ups and downs. And sometimes you sprain an ankle, you have to walk it out, like back in the day in summer camp. Walk it out. And sometimes you have to cry it out. What’s good for me is I have the opportunity to sing these songs. But I don’t believe in sitting down with a shrink. And I don’t believe in medication or painkillers. And I don’t believe in religion and giving it all up to Jesus. I believe in God. But I don’t buy into any particular, specific religion. So maybe I’m nondenominational or whatever. I just believe in God. I would never say, “Just leave it up to jesus.

**Considering the success of “Jesus Walks”**

Oh yeah, I’m sure it’s gonna be like, I don’t listen to rap in my apartment. Laughs I’m just gonna say how I feel. I believe every religion has positive points. And I look at every religion as a form of communication. I can’t be mad if someone speaks French and I speak English. I don’t think that people are going to hell because of it.

**Would you say there are a lot of people being disingenuous about that?**

Oh, definitely! People would rather fluctuate. And I’m here to say, I don’t believe that. I don’t attest to any religion that tells me that other people gotta go to hell. I don’t believe in a religion that has something against gay people. That has something against Muslims. That has something against Buddhists. I don’t buy into that. I was taught to believe everyone is going to hell. I was taught to hate gays. And I don’t really believe in any of that. Now, what I do like about church, though, is weekly inspiration. I can appreciate the weekly pep talk.

**Are you comfortable with your fame?**

I made a decision. I wanna make popular music, but I want less fans. I want the freedom of having less fans. It’s like the freedom of having less money. If you have less money, you have less responsibility. It’s like Björk, if she wanted to pose naked, you’d be like, Oh, that’s Björk. But if I wanted to pose naked, people would draw all type of things into it. I definitely feel like, in the next however many years, if I work out for two months, that I’ll pose naked. I break every rule and mentality of hip hop, of black culture, of American culture.

**You said you’d like to have less fans. Would you go back seven years and just be Kanye the producer, if you could?**

No. Let me explain when I say “less fans” what I mean by that. I’d rather have 20,000 die-hard fans that really understand and accept you as a person and a human being and an artist than to have 100,000 fly-by-night fans that only like you because you have a hit record out. One of my first steps in doing what I really want to do is the “Flashing Lights” video. That was the first piece of art that I delivered after my mom passed. Most people are like, Why don’t you show the club? No. Ít was my favorite video to date at that point. This the most incredible thing ever. I remember playing the video and being like, Ah, this shit is dope! and people just looking at me like I’m crazy. And all the fans that liked it, I’m like, Okay, cool. Let’s go. I want true fans. Would you rather have five bad model bitch girlfriends that only halfway care about you, or one wife?

**But that’s at odds with some of the things you’ve been saying — that you’re a pop artist and in competition with Coldplay and U2, who are major, stadium-selling acts. It’s difficult to have it both ways.**

Yeah, but I will though.
