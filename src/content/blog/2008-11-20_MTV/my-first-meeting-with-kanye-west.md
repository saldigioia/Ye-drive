# My First Meeting With Kanye West

Luckily, I was in place to tell the world about the guy whose beats just captivated me. His music sounded like the civil-rights movement mixed with backwoods juke-joints and Sunday-morning church services. (The kind of “sister Johnson just passed out praising the Lord, throw the white blanket over her and let her lie there sweet Jeee-sus” church services — you know, the good ones.) Even back then, Kanye could hit you with so many emotions in his tracks. Once I decided to profile him on MTV News, it didn’t really take me any time to set up the interview — I was in great standing with the Roc-A-Fella family then.

So, during our first interview in 2001 — Kanye’s first-ever interview, I believe — we talked about his producing and, surprisingly, he revealed to me that he would also be rapping. I was unsure until he played me some early recordings of “Jesus Walks” and “Hey Mama.” The guy had so much aggressive passion about his music — and still does, to this day — how could he have not been a winner?

Several months down the line, I get a call from the homie Yasmine that Kanye was in a serious car accident. When I finally got a chance to talk to him, I’ll always remember how calm and matter-of-fact he was — this is a cat who almost lost his life, and he’s telling me about this rap he just wrote called “Through the Wire.” (When Kanye says, “Story on MTV and I ain’t trying to make the band,” he’s talking about what you-know-who wrote.) He also told me about how the police were racially profiling him, what he was wearing and the car he was driving; it was classic Kanye. I did cringe, though, when he said they had to break his jaw again because the medical procedure they originally did on him was faulty. Damn.
