# Kanye West + Louis Vuitton

## Hip-Hop Kicks It With French Luxury.

When Kanye West set out to design a new line of sneakers for Louis Vuitton, he found inspiration in a high-collared jacket from the movie Dune and in a childhood memory: the moment he first laced up a pair of Air Jordans. “It was an amazing feeling,” he says. With a little guidance from LV creative director Marc Jacobs, West channeled his vision into pared-down mid-tops that stand out for their quilted rear flap, which is designed to catch the hem of your pants. “I wanted to do something different — it’s like a tongue in the back,” he says. “At first I was scared of the idea, but Marc taught me to go with what you feel and just be fearless.” West approached the project like he does his music, with perfectionist zeal. For him, style is a passion, and there’s always room for improvement. Wearing a pair of his sneakers in the front row of LV’s Paris show this year, he couldn’t help feeling covetous. “I was envious of the model wearing my shoes in red,” he says. “I thought his outfit was better than mineI need to put in a little more work.”
