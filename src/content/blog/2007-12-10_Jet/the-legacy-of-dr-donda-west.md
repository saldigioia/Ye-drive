# The Legacy of Dr. Donda West

She will be remembered as Kanye West’s mother, but Dr. Donda West left a legacy of her own.

Throughout her 31-year career in higher education, her beacon of light touched the lives of thousands of students and fellow educators.

Donda West, 58, recently was remembered during a private funeral with close family and friends at True Vine Ministries in Spencer, OK. She died November 10 of complications related to surgery or anesthesia, according to preliminary autopsy findings reported in the Los Angeles Times. West reportedly had cosmetic surgery the day before she died.

Record executive L.A. Reid, and Shawn “ Jay-Z” Carter along with girlfriend Beyonce were among stars who attended the funeral.

Common and John Legend, two of Kanye’s longtime friends, paid tribute to his mother with Legend on piano and Common rapping his hit The Light. Legend then accompanied Anita Baker as she performed one of Donda West’s favorite songs, Summertime.

West spent 24 years at Chicago State University (CSU). She was a tenured English professor who later became chairwoman of the English Department there. A few months ago she returned there as the keynote speaker at the Gwendolyn Brooks Writers’ Conference.

Friends and former colleagues of West’s had eulogized her during a memorial service at Chicago State several days earlier.

Allen-Patricia Britten, one of West’s former English students, told Jet, “Her motto from day one was, ‘There is no such thing as a dumb or stupid question.’ She made it known that whatever she knew, we would know, because our purpose for being there was to learn. That says a lot about who she was, because although she was a woman with much knowledge, her objective was not to make you feel as though you were beneath her.”

Donda West told Jet in April, “I preferred being with my students than administrative work. I was chair for six years. I elected to go back to the classroom before I retired. I like to say go forward to the classroom. The whole purpose was the students.”

Dr. West took an early retirement in 2004 at her son’s urging to become his general manager.

She held degrees from Virginia Union University, Atlanta University and Alabama’s Auburn University. West then began her teaching career at Atlanta’s Morris Brown College.

“When I left Morris Brown, I was making a little over $7,000 a year. “Can you imagine?” she told Jet earlier this year. “When we moved to Chicago (in 1980), instantly I felt rich. I started at Chicago State at $17,000...There were a lot of benefits with me being a university professor. I would travel a lot and our stay in China for a year was because I was foreign expert to the People’s Republic of China, teaching English.”

Most recently she served as CEO of West Brands, LLC, and was chairwoman of Kanye’s Loop Dreams Foundation.

She was not just her only son’s biggest cheerleader and fan, but in 2005 she got in on the act and performed Jesus Walks with him during a routine at the Grammy Awards. “My mama can bust some Usher moves!” Kanye said.

Last Mother’s Day the rap star told Jet the best advice his mother gave him about his career was “to kiss Nia Long instead of Pamela Anderson in the Touch The Sky video.”

In celebration of her memoir, Raising Kanye, she graced the cover of Jet with her son and said “the next big thing” she was looking forward to was having a new daughter-in-law, Alexis Phifer (Jet, May 14,2007).

“I’m so looking forward to it,” she gushed, saying they were all planning to celebrate Mother’s Day in the Bahamas. “I think they are a wonderful couple. I’m looking forward to whenever they get married and having grandchildren. I want them to give that first grandbaby to me! One of my challenges is living in the now. I try to enjoy everyday and whatever it brings. I’m blessed and so fortunate to have such a great daughter-in-law to be.”

In addition to her son, West is survived by her parents, Portwood Sr. and Lucille Williams; a brother, Portwood Williams Jr. (wife Beverly); one sister, Shirlie Scoggins Sullivan (husband Vester); an aunt, one godsister and a host of other relatives.
