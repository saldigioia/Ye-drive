# Kanye West and Friends Go Back to School

After taking a self-imposed break from the spotlight the past eight months, Kanye West returned to the stage Tuesday — his 33rd birthday — to perform in front of public school students who improved their grades, behavior and attendance.

The Kanye West Foundation’s third annual Stay in School event brought West to Farragut Career Academy and John Marshall Metropolitan and Percy L. Julian high schools, unlike in past years when West brought students to the House of Blues and Chicago Theatre to watch him rhyme.

As if a concert featuring one of music’s biggest stars wasn’t enough, West had fellow Chicago rappers Lupe Fiasco and Common join him at each show. (Farragut, Marshall and Julian posted the highest gains among seven participating Chicago schools, according to the foundation.)

The six-song set at Farragut began with a track from Fiasco, followed by one from Common.

“We want to congratulate you on the incredible job you’ve done in school,” said Common, later adding, “Whatever, you do, be the best at it.”

Shortly after that, the man of the hour made his way onstage — decked out in sunglasses — to perform “Run This Town,” “Good Life,” “Power” and “Touch the Sky.” (Television cameras were not allowed to tape the recently leaked “Power,” which will be on West’s forthcoming album.)

The Grammy-winning rapper left most of the talking to Fiasco and Common. West wasn’t made available to media at the event.

The mini-concert at Farragut ended with more than 1,600 students, all wearing white Kanye West Foundation T-shirts, serenading West with “Happy Birthday.”

“This is a fantastic thing that proves that when all students get together ... they can achieve great things,” Chicago Public Schools Chief Executive Ron Huberman said.
