# West Takes Hip-Hop New Places

“Never before in hip-hop ...”

You get the feeling Kanye West is going to use that phrase a lot before he rides into the sunset.

Sunday night at the Petersen Events Center he was referring to the six shadowy figures behind him — an actual string section that even included a harpist. In the hip-hop world it’s novel enough to have live musicians on the stage, let alone a group capable of breaking into Bartok at any moment.

But West is mainstream rap’s leading visionary at the moment, so you can’t rule anything out. Only two albums into his career, the producer-turned-rapper from Chi-town has soared to headliner status with a backpack full of hits and an athletic stage presence that’s put him on the A-list for every music awards show but the country ones.

The only thing he didn’t have going for him Sunday night was a good soundman — surprising for a guy who has mastered sound the way West has. For a good bit of the set, the backing tracks supplied by his DJ and keyboardist pummeled everything else in the mix and, even though it’s a gym, I hesitate to blame the Petersen because there’s been good sound there before.

The videographer wasn’t on the ball either, cueing the wrong video to start the show, prompting a voiceover to request, “Please run the correct intro.”

Fortunately, West has the charisma, not to mention the songs, to overcome all of that. Hitting the stage with a flashy white suit and big shades, he kicked things off on a positive note with horn- fueled “Touch the Sky.”

Early on, the string section — eerily silhouetted with the rest of the musicians behind a white screen — got its best workout, oddly enough, on the aerobic parody “The New Workout Plan.”

The “never before in hip-hop” line could have applied to the two most heartfelt songs of the night, shout-outs to his favorite women — his grandmother on “Roses,” delivered kneeling next to a hospital bed, and his “mommy” on “Hey Mama,” complete with a montage of her pictures on the screen.

While most hip-hop artists choose to bask in their own hype, West offered a hilarious twist on “Bring Me Down,” scrolling reviews — such as “Kanye West is totally overrated,” “Now that he’s rich, he’s wack” and “one of the most ignorant celebrities out there” — on the screen behind him.

Outside a group was selling T-shirts that said “Kanye West was right,” referring to his comment that “George Bush doesn’t like black people.” Inside, West didn’t dwell on it, merely slipping his name into the “All Falls Down” lyric, “Drug dealer buy Jordans/ crackhead buy crack/And George Bush get paid off of all of that” — to big cheers, of course.

But Kanye and George do have a hero in common: Jesus. He was given a revival meeting-like salute on the unlikely hit “Jesus Walks,” part of a momentum build that included a confetti shower on “Celebration” and a show-stopping version of “Diamonds Are Forever,” that had most people in the crowd of 4,500 holding their hands up in the diamond shape.

Overrated? You’d have a hard time making that argument to the energized fans walking out of The Pete Sunday night.

The same goes for Fantasia, who followed an uneventful track performance by Keyshia with a set that made a good argument for her as the best product of “American Idol.” Fantasia bounded out like she was about to fight Hilary Swank in “Million Dollar Baby” and, with a crack band, pounded home a set of R&B, soul and rock with a fierce passion and vocal cords to beat all. Her “AI” performances and her debut record, while good, don’t prepare you for what a force Fantasia is. She didn’t write songs like “Baby Mama” and “It’s All Good,” but she was feeling them, and her set-closing cover of Aerosmith’s “Dream On” may have even scared Steven Tyler.
