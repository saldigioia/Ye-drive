# Kanye’s Line to the Lord

A self-styled “ghetto Pope” reckons he’s the closest hip-hop has to the Lord, says NICK PAPPS

KANYE West is not happy. For the past 10 minutes, the hip-hop star has been arguing with his girlfriend on his phone and she’s threatening to break up with him if he even dares end this conversation.

On and on, the argument goes. West accuses the girlfriend of some misdemeanour with rap kingpin Jay-Z, then they’re revisiting some past conversation and, all the while, West is trying to tell his girlfriend he can’t talk because he’s in an interview and there’s someone here.

“I’m at work,” he says, his right leg bouncing up and down as he grows more and more agitated. “You know I can’t talk now. I’ve got stuff to do.”

Finally, after another couple more minutes of exasperated exchanges, West and his girlfriend agree to talk later, the mobile phone is folded up and West is ready to get back to work and start talking about his new album, Late Registration.

Due out next month, Late Registration is the follow-up to the 2004 hit album The College Dropout, which sold three million copies, was nominated for 10 Grammy Awards, helped land West a place in Time magazine’s 100 most influential people, and single-handedly turned him into one of the hottest names in hip-hop.

Not surprisingly, West admits he was more than a little nervous entering the recording studio to make his second solo album.

“The pressure was on,” he said. “The heat is on.

“But that’s the joy of being under pressure, to go back and win that second championship. The ability to create and be creative is the reason why I think I can overcome the sophomore slump.”

Australia will get its first taste of West’s new album tomorrow when the track Diamonds from Sierra Leone is released.

At a private listening session a couple of days before this interview, West explained the rap had a social message and was aimed at telling the world about the civil wars in Sierra Leone fuelled by the diamond trade.

The rather religious West told me God told him to write the track and added, not entirely immodestly, that “I’m, like, a ghetto Pope. God is the executive producer of my life and I’m the closest hip-hop has to God.”

Later, he elaborates on his personal connection with the man upstairs.

“Diamonds from Sierra Leone is not something I set out to do,” he said.

“It’s something that He wanted me to tell people about.

“He sent the right people, the right angels to deliver the message and now the message is delivered on an international scale.

“It’s about spreading knowledge.”

West’s religious faith, first seen on his debut album with the track Jesus Walks, makes him a bit of an anomaly in the tough world of gangsta rap, where drugs and guns get more than a passing reference and where a bulletproof vest-wearing ex-drug-dealing rapper called 50 Cent is the big dog on the block.

But as he munched on a stick of carrot and sipped some water, West, who sported a multi-coloured woollen jumper with no bulletproof vest in sight, said he and 50 Cent were just two sides of the hip-hop movement.

West even confessed to more than a passing admiration for 50 and his raps about life on the mean streets.

“50 is like this king from another land and I am like respectful,” he said.

“50 is one of my favourites.”

West also said the two shared a few similarities, not least of which was the fact they both had a history of “overcoming a near-fatal, tragic situation”.

For 50 Cent, his brush with death was a May 2000 shooting that left him with nine bullet holes and a permanent lisp, courtesy of a shot that pierced his cheek.

West’s near-death experience was an October 2002 car crash as he drove away from an LA recording studio. The accident left his jaw shattered in three spots, his face wired together and forever scarred and provided the inspiration for his first hit single Through the Wire.

“There are so many things that are similar, but his (50 Cent) niche is he provides this type of music and I provide that type of music,” West said.

“But a lot of things are similar — the hustler mentality, the leader mentality of leading a span of people, wanting to make music that touches the world in a certain way.

“We’re so similar, though. We’re the yin and the yang.”

It seems the two might also be set to continue their parallel lives into the movie world with 50 Cent recently finishing a film on his life called Bulletproof while West said he, too, was set to move into the movie industry.

He wants to produce and be like the biggest name in the business, director and producer Steven Spielberg.

“I feel more of a role in entertaining,” West said. “I felt like I was the rap Ben Stiller or the rap Dave Chappelle at one point but now, with this new album, I am saying I am more the rap Steven Spielberg.”

West said just as Spielberg made his popcorn movies such as E.T. and social-conscience films such as Schindler’s List, he, too, had different styles in his music.

“He expresses all these different things and that’s kind of what I do,” he said, giving as an example two songs from College Dropout.

West said his Schindler’s List equivalent was the conscience rap Jesus Walks while his E.T. was the bump-and-grind track Slow Jamz.

“I’m in a rap position of a Spielberg when I do a Jesus Walks — it’s a Schindler’s List,” he said. “It’s so impactful because I gave you E.T., I gave you Slow Jamz.”

As West continues to expand on his thoughts, he mentions he has ambitions beyond music and films, revealing he might also be involved in a cure for AIDS and cancer.

“The sky’s the limit,” he said. “I am not talented for anything except the ability to learn.

“And if I am really convinced by something, if it’s something that really means a lot to me, then not only will I be able to learn how to do it to the point where I can be successful at it — but I will do it to the point where it pushes whatever that is, ahead of where it was before I got into it.”

It’s about now that I ask West if his self-belief is sometimes misinterpreted as, perhaps, arrogance.

West dismisses the notion.

“How do you tell a car that has an endless gas supply that he’s not going to drive across the country?” he said.

“I know that I have endless gas. My mother told me: `Don’t think you will go broke one day. Of course plan for the worst, but expect the best.’ So many people don’t expect the best.”

Clearly, West expects the best.

*Single “Diamonds from Sierra Leone” is out tomorrow. The album Late Registration is out on August 28.*
