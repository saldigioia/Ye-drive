## Kanye West Is Heckled by Bored Festival-Goers After 20 Minute Rant

He relishes in being one of the most outspoken rappers of our time, but US rapper Kanye West officially bored festival-goers yesterday when people walked away from his set after a 20 minute rant.

The Bound 2 star was booed and heckled on the opening night of Wireless festival in London yesterday evening after he indulged in an expletive-ridden rant during his 90-minute set.

The self-indulgent star ranted: “I’m not particularly angry but they’ve taken the idea of celebrity and tried to make me seem like I’m stupid or something.

“People keep looking at me like I got a problem or something, like I’m not doing something I’m meant to. The lies, the media, they want to make you feel like you’re less to them in their eye.”

The rapper, who played hits including Stronger, Cold, Diamonds From Sierra Leone, Heartless and Jesus Walks, also took a pop at fashion brands Nike and Louis Vuitton, with whom he has had feuds, and the idea of celebrity during his fiery tirade.

Kim Kardashian’s other half ended his long-running partnership with Nike to sign a deal with rival Adidas amid a row over royalties and creative freedom.

Yeezy added: “Don’t discriminate against me ‘cos I’m a black man or a celebrity.

“I’m not going to mention Nike or say names but if you’re creative, want to create more, this is exactly what I’m talking about. They say, ‘No no no n*****, that’s too much’. It’s about my dreams, it’s about creating, not about the idea of being a f****** celebrity.

“That wasn’t my fault about Nike - they tried to control me. I just want to make something awesome, hang around my awesome friends and save the world.

“A lot of people don’t realise they own power, they own connection. They say, ‘How can Kanye go down his whole career and say so much vile s***?’ It’s because I got the Clique,” he said before launching into his track, Clique.

Yesterday evening was meant to be Kanye’s only set but he is preparing step in for Canadian rapper Drake, who dropped out of his headlining slot due to illness, this evening.

The Take Care singer had been scheduled to take to the stage on Saturday, but West will now play a second night in London.

Who knows if the latest addition to the Kardashian clan will repeat his rant, but if fancies keeping his audience entertained he might want to sick to spitting beats and bars rather than spouting off.
