# Kanye West and the Healing Power of a Hit

Many prominent hip-hoppers flaunt mouths packed with metal, but Kanye West's metallic trap was one he could have done without. Just weeks after a life-threatening 2002 car accident, he chronicled the sordid episode in "Through the Wire," a hit he recorded with his jaw wired shut. With a fully flexible mouth, the rapper-producer performed for nearly 90 minutes at the University of Maryland's Grand Ballroom in College Park Thursday.

Anticipation for West's sold-out gig was feverish. He has three production credits on three singles in Billboard's top 25. Though the affair was plagued by the cavernous ballroom's poor acoustics, West, along with a DJ and keyboardist, rolled though spirited songs from his solo debut.

With a look that's more Hamptons than Harlem, West donned a blue striped shirt with the collar pointed toward the ceiling. When he became overheated in a hooded jacket, it wasn't simply tossed aside. The snappy dresser folded it first -- a skill he likely honed while working at the Gap. He told of those retail woes in the somber "Spaceship" and admitted loving things that bling in "All Falls Down" by quipping, "Man I promise / I'm so self conscious /That's why you always see me with one of my watches."

Part of the affable West's mammoth appeal is he rhymes for thugs and thinkers alike. Among the tunes he performed Thursday was the faith-inspired "Jesus Walks." Marked by a systematic snare drum, it's a combo of gospel and rap.
