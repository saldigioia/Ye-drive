# Hip Hop in Chinos

## Kanye West Brixton Academy

Everyone wishes hip hop would change, even its staunchest fans. Like Northern Ireland in the 1970s, it has become an impasse, a perpetual cycle of violence and gangsterism, its happy outcome unforeseeable.

No wonder Kanye West has been embraced so warmly across the world. Operating in Chicago, outside rap’s bi-coastal polarities, this 26-year-old, middle-class, multi-tasking wunderkind has emerged as a figure of hope. He’s the guy whom all parties can work with, who eschews standard muscle-flexing, instead voicing people’s fears and insecurities, talking the language of peace.

Celebrating phenomenal UK sales of his album, The College Dropout, which placed him in the Super League alongside Eminem and 50 Cent, he arrived on stage dressed for an Ivy League wine and cheese evening: sandy-colored chinos, chocolate-brown suede loafers, a white blazer, and a Pringle diamond sweater. The only trace of hip hop’s “bling” extravagance was his necklace, a diamond-encrusted gold head of Christ.

He was greeted like a visiting messiah by the audience, who were of an even, good-natured racial mix. West’s DJ introduced him by playing Five to One by the Doors. If that song’s “no one here gets out alive” threat disappointingly nodded towards hip hop cliche, so did much of the ensuing performance.

Though there was no weaponry and comparatively little offensiveness, the turntable-generated beats bumped lumpily from the PA while West prowled, pointed, and shouted over the top, with little of his lyrics’ questioning sensitivity. The crucial element in his sound, the speeded-up soul-diva vocal samples, was drowned out by the helium shrieks of his female admirers, which reached a new intensity when, after 10 minutes, he showily removed his blazer.

Having worked up a head of steam, he duly flashed a billion-dollar smile and let his DJ take over (hip hop’s answer to the drum solo). West returned to deliver his hits All Falls Down, Slow Jamz, and Through the Wire, with a backup rapper who barely got a word in edgeways. Only room for one ego up there. West’s chinos began to show sweat marks across the bum.

The one track which really warranted perspiration, the thumping Jesus Walks, made a brilliant encore. West threw T-shirts into the crowd before adding with typical rapper’s avarice, “You can buy them at the back, too.”
