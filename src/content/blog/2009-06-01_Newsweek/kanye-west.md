# Kanye West

Feel the world is beating you down? Kanye West, a man frequently at battle — with, say, the president, or with Grammy voters — has written a short volume of aphorisms titled Thank You and You’re Welcome. He spoke with NEWSWEEK’s Seth Colter Walls:

**You’ve said you were inspired to write this book by reading J. Sakiya Sandifer’s, which was also a short, spiral-bound volume. What about that appealed to you?**

Well, because I was sitting at dinner tables — or in my car service, or traveling the world — and random thoughts would come to me. These quotes, these very poignant quotes, were just similar to having really good punch lines in a rap song. The punch lines of your life.

**One of the lines in the book is “If everybody thinks it’s right, you’re doing something wrong.” Does that explain why you can be controversial?**

I don’t think about that. But I have to admit, coming from all the adversity of backlash [in response to] just having my own opinion, this is an emancipating idea of mine. Sometimes people beat you down for having a different opinion. I want to stand up and say, no, this is how I really feel.

**Has it ever been the case that, looking back, the people who said you were wrong turned out to be right?**

I can’t think of a particular example like that. But that is something about being a trailblazer: you won’t always take the right track. I’m not a psychic.
