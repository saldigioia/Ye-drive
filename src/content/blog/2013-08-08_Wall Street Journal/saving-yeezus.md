# Saving ‘Yeezus’

When Kanye West’s “Yeezus” was released in mid-June, Randy Seay, a Baltimore-based DJ and producer known as Matic808, purchased the album on iTunes. He then uploaded it into his FL Studio software and, with the use of a MIDI keyboard, remixed it, taking about three hours to complete each track. He posted his work on Soundcloud.com, drawing modest attention not only to his talent but also to a form of dance music known as Baltimore Club.

To Mr. Seay, 22, who not long ago was known as DJ Lil’ Matic — the 808 in the new name comes from a Roland drum machine — Baltimore Club is the kind of music club-goers want when they hit the dance floor. Key elements include jagged syncopation, allegiance to hip-hop and rap accents and rhythms, a slightly faster tempo than contemporary electronic dance music, and a reliance on songs from which to sample recognizable melodies and riffs.

“It’s the whole energy of it,” he said by phone from Baltimore. “The beats make you want to have fun — they induce good energy.” He added, with pride: “Anybody who likes any kind of music can like it.”

By subjecting Mr. West’s music to the Baltimore Club treatment, Mr. Seay liberated some of the originals, especially those co-produced by Daft Punk’s Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo that tap into the mainstream rise of EDM.

Mr. West’s album opener, “On Sight,” kicks off with a blast of dubstep that locks into a rigid rhythm; Mr. Seay punches it up with jittery breakbeats while chopping Mr. West’s obscene rant into repetitive chants. On “Black Skinhead,” he discards the percussion that Mr. West uses — culled from Marilyn Manson’s “Beautiful People” — and places new patterns under the altered top line, including different staccato drumming late in the track. He radically reworks “Send It Up,” tossing aside Mr. West’s hooks, including the Beenie Man sample used in the fade.

“A lot of my friends, they kind of don’t like it,” he said of “Yeezus.” “But when I heard it, I thought: ‘This is really nice.’” In response to a comment that his version swings more than Mr. West’s, Mr. Seay said, “No, I thought Kanye’s swung.”

As for Mr. West’s confrontational, occasionally pornographic lyrics, which can be viewed as social commentary or the venting of a troubled mind, Mr. Seay said, “To me, when I listened to Kanye’s music, it’s all pain. I don’t believe everybody hurts in the same way.”

Mr. Seay, who has been making music since he was 15, said Baltimore Club music is at a pivotal point in its development, which was stunted by the accidental death in 2008 of Khia Danielle Edgerton, known as DJ K-Swift. She spun Baltimore Club on commercial radio and at live shows, and released more than a dozen compilations of locally produced music, including a pair for kids.

“K-Swift was No. 1. She prided herself on popping new music. When she died, you could feel people pushing it even harder,” Mr. Seay said. “But people didn’t have the same kind of love. The energy lasted about two years. It couldn’t hold on.” He finds the music spun now at local clubs “stagnant,” he said. “The only new music they want to play is the kind that sounds like old music.”

Much like Go-go music in Washington, Baltimore Club hasn’t found a national audience, though DJ Class’s “I’m the Ish” broke out in 2009. Mr. Seay said the attention he’s drawing for his “Yeezus” is building — without radio support or distribution by a record label, and without geographic borders. “It’s a word-of-mouth thing now. I’ve been getting a lot of emails.”

Last week on Soundcloud, Mr. Seay posted a crackling remix of Drake’s recent single, “All Me,” and announced that he’s open to submissions for collaborations. He’s now at work on an EP of new music as well as producing several rap projects.

“Being predictable don’t set you apart,” he said.
