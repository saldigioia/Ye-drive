# Hip-Hop’s New Big Shot

## Kanye West Talks About His Next Surprising Moves and Why Marriage Is the Key to Life

Between heaven and earth, nerds and gangstas, frailty and faith, and sin and grace-somewhere in the mix-lies Kanye West.

At 27 years old, the Chicago-bred quadruple threat (producer/rapper/songwriter/record exec) has somehow figured out a way to make millions from humanity’s contradictions and the juxtaposition of the moneyed mainstream and the avant-garde nature of hip-hop-an amalgamation of the street hustler’s credo and the Black Protestant ethos.

With his debut CD, The College Dropout, having sold 2.6 million copies, and having produced or written hits for Jay-Z, Alicia Keys, Usher, Twista and Brandy, West has, in a remarkably short time, become one of the most celebrated names in the music industry, and one of the hottest rappers in the business, offering further evidence of hip-hop’s increasing influence on American culture. His sophomore album (the second in what he conceives as a four-disc set), Late Registration, is due out by early summer.

“The best thing [about the success] is being able to get my creative ideas out,” West says from Los Angeles, on his way to a fitting for the 47th Annual Grammy Awards, where he took home three awards and gave a show-stopping performance. “That’s why I rap in the first place-so my voice can be heard.”

With soulful beats, thought-provoking rhymes and a stirring musicality, West crafted a freshman disc that critics said filled a void in hiphop-occupying the gap between the “hard-knock life” espoused by rappers such as Def Jam President and CEO Jay-Z, from whom Kanye got his biggest break by producing tracks on The Blueprint, and the you-gotta-be-down consciousness of performers like Common, whose next disc, Be, is set to launch this spring from West’s own Getting Out Our Dreams (G.O.O.D.) label.

“A major part of Kanye’s success is, of course, his talent,” says “hip-hop violinist” Miri Ben-Ari, who worked extensively with West on Dropout. “He has a vision for things, for example, to bring live instrumentalists back to the game and create music like they did back in the day. Kanye is very open to new things; he is not afraid to think differently, to take a chance and to say his thoughts out loud.”

Saying his thoughts out loud has sometimes gotten West into trouble. Dropout was one of the best-reviewed albums of the year, but there was a reluctance to declare it a “classic,” which burned West to no end. It wasn’t completely OK to like Kanye, it seemed. Even he admits that he’s not the best rapper or programmer, but he just knew that his album was the best. And he told everyone.

Turns out he was right, on several levels. The disc charted multiple hit singles, and Kanye, who some whispered or hollered was a legend in his own mind, created what has come to be known by many as one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time.

This past summer, when the spiritual/rap anthem “Jesus Walks” hit radio and the three (yes, three) videos for the song hit MTV, West really blew up. They said he had made a space for God in hip-hop. Is he really a Christian, people wondered? Why is he mixing God and sex on the same album? Practically everybody wanted to know.

The buzz was buzzing, and by the end of the year, some critics forgot their previously warm responses and declared the West brand sizzling.

“If Kanye West never makes another album, or another beat, he has already secured a place in the history of hip-hop for producing one of the greatest, most innovative hip-hop albums in recent times,” says Michael Eric Dyson, University of Pennsylvania professor and author of Holler If You Hear Me: Searching for Tupac Shakur. “College Dropout fuses two seemingly disparate communities within hip-hop... In essence, he’s appealed simultaneously to both the most commercial elements of hip-hop and its most socially and spiritually sensitive side as well.”

To those who called him boastful and pride-filled, West offers a tongue-in-cheek men culpa. “I really believed in myself,” West says. “And you know, I want to just apologize to everybody out there who says I’m arrogant. I apologize to everybody for believing in myself.”

So far, that belief has served him well. Kanye, who now has homes on both coasts, says that he’s not really serious when he says “I-told-you-so” to all the doubters; he’s just “having fun.”

At the same time, though, West acknowledges how intensely personal his first disc is because of what happened during the recording of it. It was October 2002 and Damon Dash had signed him to Roc-A-Fella. Driving his Lexus back to the hotel after a late night in the studio, West fell asleep and remembers waking up to a steering wheel coming at his face and being in excruciating pain. The near-fatal car crash broke his jaw in three places.

Throughout his recovery, during which reconstructive surgery left his jaw wired shut, working on Dropout helped get him through. It saved him, just as God had saved him. And if someone comes along and criticizes a part of you that means so much, he says, you’re bound to get a bit defensive.

“I feel like the album was my medicine,” says West, who bought his mother a Mercedes, but hasn’t replaced the Lexus. “It would take my mind away from the pain-away from the dental appointments, from my teeth killing me, from my mouth being wired shut, from the fact that I looked like I just fought Mike Tyson... The recced wouldn’t have been as big without the accident... I nearly died. That’s the best thing that can happen to a rapper.”

The accident changed the course of West’s life, one shaped by faith, family and geography. Born in Atlanta and raised on Chicago’s South Side, Kanye (which means the “only one” in Swahili) is the only child of Dr. Donda West, who retired early as head of the English department at Chicago J State University and is now her son’s general manager, and Ray West, a former Black Panther and photojournalist who is now a pastoral counselor. His parents divorced when he was 3, but Kanye spent summers with his father, who lives in Maryland. He graduated early from high school, dropped out of art school and then left Chicago State because he wanted to pursue music full-time. He headed to the East Coast in 2001.

“I was really raised in the church, and raised as a good Black man,” West recalls of his middle-class, fall-into-the-Gap upbringing. “I don’t want to offend people. I want to help people and do as much as I can for them. And I think that God blesses me in return... I’m here, for the most part, doing His work. That’s why He left me here.”

West also believes that he’s here to share his life with someone special. Months ago, he was in a relationship with a woman he declined to name publicly, but now he’s unattached. He looks for-ward, however, to getting married and providing for a family of his own. He says marriage and family are where you find true happiness.

“[Marriage is] the key to life,” West says. “I’ll definitely be married someday when I find somebody.”

The list of what West wants in a woman is pretty long and immediate (as if he’s given it quite a bit of thought), but here are the highlights: She must be intelligent, attractive, understanding, with “a really dope sense of style that’s fresh to death.”

“She has to be able to dress; that’s just a common interest,” says West, who is debuting a fashion line next spring. “She has to like movies and like all sorts of music-anywhere from alternative to the Diplomats.”

In the meantime, West is trying to keep all the fame in perspective and is focusing on diversifying his career. In addition to the new fashion line, there are plans for developing a TV show, as well as directing more videos. He also has established the Kanye West Foundation to support music education in schools. The foundation’s first program is “Loop Dreams,” which puts music production equipment in schools and establishes an incentive program that appeals to students who, like West in his day, are interested in nontraditional curriculum. You have to have some “dessert with the dinner,” West declares, to motivate young people to stay in school.

“A lot of people have misconceptions about my views on education,” he adds. “I feel like high school is a necessity, but college is a choice. ...[Some people] have no idea what they’re even going to college for, other than they believe that’s what you’re supposed to do.”

West knows that making music is the major part of what he’s supposed to do, and he also knows he’s only as good as his next project. He’s hush-hush on the details of the new album, but he reflects on what three Grammy Awards might mean for his relatively short career. Validation? Industry insiders say that a Grammy win means more exposure, legitimacy and increased record sales.

“Winning a Grammy doesn’t guarantee a long, successful career,” West says. “I don’t think you should think about that at all when it’s time to work on other music.”

What West does think about is taking life head on, living his dreams and strengthening his relationship with God, with whom he says he talks all the time. He says God not only allowed him to live, but also took away his greatest fear.

“I used to be afraid of death,” Kanye says. “Being that I was so close to dying, I realized that nothing in life is promised except death. So, while I’m here, I have to make the most of it.”
