Last night, Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, brought his signature flair and creativity to the Forum d'Assago in Milan for an exclusive listening party for his new album, 'Vultures 1', a collaboration with Ty Dolla $ign. The event proved that Kanye is a master at subverting the traditional performer/spectator dynamic.

In a bold move, Kanye announced two Italian dates (Milan and Bologna) just a week in advance, forcing fans to make a snap decision about attending. Despite the short notice and high ticket prices (starting at 100 euros), the allure of experiencing Kanye's latest work in a unique setting was too strong to resist.

As the show began, Kanye's wife, Bianca Censori, made a stunning entrance, slowly walking around the perimeter of the stage and captivating the audience. Moments later, a masked figure emerged from the shadows, illuminated by a single spotlight. It was Kanye himself, dressed in all black, including a puffy North Face jacket. Although he teased the audience by briefly lifting his mask a few times, his identity remained largely concealed throughout the performance.

The listening party followed the tracklist of 'Vultures 1' from start to finish, with Kanye and his collaborators, including Ty Dolla $ign and surprise guests like Quavo, Freddie Gibbs, and Jaden Smith, bringing the music to life through their energetic presence and movements on stage. The absence of live vocals and microphones only heightened the focus on the music and the artists' physical expressions.

One of the highlights of the evening was the track 'Carnival', which features a recording of the Inter Milan football club's ultras chanting. The crowd's response to this song was electric, drawing comparisons to the iconic "Seven Nation Army" chant that became the unofficial anthem of Italy's 2006 World Cup team.

As the 90-minute show drew to a close, opinions were divided on whether the event was a collective hallucination or a groundbreaking new way to experience music. Despite the lack of live singing, the 'Vultures 1' listening party delivered a memorable and immersive experience that showcased Kanye's ability to push the boundaries of live performance.

The genius of Kanye's approach lies in its transformation of the traditional concert format into a giant, collective karaoke session where the artist and the audience are united in their enjoyment of the music. By promising top-notch audio quality and the chance to see a lineup of international stars who rarely visit Italy, Kanye has once again proven himself to be a trailblazer in the music industry.

Love it or hate it, there's no denying that Kanye West's 'Vultures 1' listening party in Milan was an epic event that only he could pull off. It's a testament to his creativity, vision, and ability to constantly surprise and engage his fans in new and exciting ways.
