**Kanye West:** Information super highway. It's the wave of the future.

**RapTapes.com:** I heard Royce da 5'9" cheated you out of the 'Heartbeat' track. Has that ever happened to you before and do you have any words to anyone that has done it to you before, Royce included?

**Kanye West:** No, why would I have words with anyone that has done that? It's not going to make me any money.

**Kanye West:** Of course. When you write my answer dont write 'yes' write 'of course.' Don't change my words for real. You can even put this part just do not change my words. This isnt anything against you, just dont change my words. People be always changing my words and they take away from what the people need to hear.

**RapTapes.com:** I heard the doctor set your jaw wrong and they have to re-set it. Whats the status of that?

**Kanye West:** I'm going back and forth on that. I think I might even look better now that my face has swollen down, before I had my jaw broke my mouth used to stick out more. I think it pushed my jaw back and shit, it looks better now.
