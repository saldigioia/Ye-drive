# Hip-Hop Hero of the Year: Kanye West

Producer turned performer Kanye West is tub-humping home his position as hip-hop hero of the year at the Brixton Academy. It’s not immediately obvious as he gets busy with the microphone, just what it is that has made him the talent of choice for both the demanding hip-hop aficionado and the passing pop trade. The natty rhymes, the dramatic life and death stories, the definite narrative pull of his debut album, *The College Dropout,* where the awkward, vulnerable nerd enacts triumphant revenge on those that doubted him - it’s nowhere to be heard. If he is, as has been said, the savior of hip hop as a creative force, then it seems tonight as if this is only because he knows how to party with a certain kind of frenzied elegance. The show isn’t the financially driven gangsta-and-guns cartoon goonery that threatened to terminate hip hop, but neither does it seem to be the sensitive, zany spirituality West displays on Dropout.

It’s just him, a hyperactive turntablist, a backing tape, and a rap sidekick/straight man. It’s the essence of the hip-hop side-show as a stripped-down mixture of rousing rally and fame-fanning personal appearance.

The hip-hop virgin would note the lack of instruments on stage, the lack of singing, the lack of just about all the comforting things you would associate with a conventional concert performance. Ultimately, it’s just one man and his rant. He restlessly roams the stage. There’s plenty of room.

The virgin would be bemused that it is impossible to understand a word that Kanye is saying, even though a large part of the whole point must be what he’s saying. There are a lot of words, none of them distinct, all of them lost in the muffled slabs of noise that shudder out of nowhere and plummet straight back there. Phantom slivers of melody struggle to survive inside the boiling barrage of beats. West’s absurdist flourishes and tempo-shredding rhythms are smothered by blank volume. It’s pure physical assault.

The virgin might doubt it, but hip-hop combines infectious, abstract electronic music and dramatically self-conscious autobiographical poetry. There’s no solution tonight as to how this pioneering hybrid of the experimental, the technological, and the literate can be as ground-breaking on stage as it has been on disc. It’s just a case of representing the self-confidence in the studio and fluid lyrical zest that has led to his success through flashy, full-frontal entertainment that relies on a boastful personality rather than sonic surprise. You can see and feel the charisma of the man who has helped restore some of hip-hop’s more thoughtful, oblique pleasures if not actually hear how he transformed this charisma into sound.

Consequently, it’s unclear whether West’s music is absolutely classic, or something fun and dandy with the shelf life of a comedy album. Is he a visionary sparkling with genius, or simply another sensationalist compiler of gimmicks, beats, and samples? Is he the sound of 2004, or the sound of the future? Ah, the eternal mysteries of the hip-hop world.
