# Kanye West: Rapper and Reanimator

For the video to “Heard ‘Em Say,” the third single from his double-platinum album “Late Registration,” the rabble-rousing rapper Kanye West hired the French director Michel Gondry. Mr. Gondry, celebrated for his many inventive music videos as well as for the film “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,” delivered his finished product. But with less than two weeks to go before it was due at MTV, the rapper changed his mind. He fired Mr. Gondry and called up a very different sort of filmmaker: the animator Bill Plympton.

Twice nominated for an Oscar, Mr. Plympton is perhaps best known for the body-morphing shorts — “25 Ways to Quit Smoking,” “How to Kiss” — that used to be shown on MTV in the late 80’s. His sometimes-naïve, always-whimsical style might seem an unusual choice to illustrate a hip-hop song. But not to the idiosyncratic Mr. West. “He told me he’s always loved my work, and that my images were important to him as a kid,” Mr. Plympton said. “And he was always curious. He would call me from all over the place: ‘Oh Bill, I’m watching ‘I Married a Strange Person’ right now. How did you do this and that?’ “

To capture the tone of “Heard ‘Em Say,” which is a gentle lamentation on poverty and racism, Mr. Plympton depicted Mr. West as a cab driver (above) in an imaginary city and picking up troubled passengers, including a young boy and his mother. “The child is meant to represent Kanye as a young boy and the film is about his experiences,” Mr. Plympton said. “Conversely, he wanted the mother to be very sexy, so we did that, too.”

Mr. Plympton’s latest animated short, “The Fan and the Flower,” features voicing by the actor Paul Giamatti and has been shortlisted for a 2006 Oscar nomination. He’s also at work on a half-hour documentary for the History Channel on the 1786 Shays’ Rebellion in Massachusetts, and a video for the pop comedian Weird Al Yankovic for a number called “Don’t Download This Song” (sung to the tune of “We Are the World”).

Even next to Weird Al, though, Mr. West is “a real showman,” Mr. Plympton said: “He wanted a scene at the end of the video where his character went to the pearly gates and was rejected. I had to tell him, ‘We only have one day to go, and getting the pearly gates right would be almost impossible.’ Thankfully, he understood.”
