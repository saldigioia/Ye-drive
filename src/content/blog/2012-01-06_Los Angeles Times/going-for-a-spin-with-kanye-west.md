# Going for a Spin With Kanye West

## As Yeezyworldpeace, He Took the DJ Booth at 1 OAK in Las Vegas on New Year's Eve.

Kanye West earns a living as a rap impresario and moonlights in fashion with women's apparel and sneaker design collaborations. But there's a new bullet point on his resume: celebrity DJ.

On New Year's Eve in Las Vegas, West climbed into the booth to spin the grand opening of 1 OAK — the Mirage hotel and casino edition of New York City's exclusive haunt from Scott Sartiano and Richie Akiva.

Under the name "Yeezyworldpeace," West played hits of his own (natch) like "Gold Digger," "Good Life" and the ubiquitous duet "... in Paris" with Jay-Z. He also included hip-hop, pop and '80s tunes for the three-hour set.

The club tapped Fergie, who showed with husband Josh Duhamel, as a guest host to ring in 2012. Celebs including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Topher Grace, Kid Cudi and Jason Ritter danced to West's playlist. In case you have a bad case of FOMO (fear of missing out), here's an exclusive sampling from his three-hour set so you can carry DJ Kanye wherever you go:

- "The Devil's Den" — Skrillex and Wolfgang Gartner

- "King of Hearts" — Cassie

- "Rock With You" — Michael Jackson

- "Shut It Down" — Pitbull featuring Akon

- "We Found Love" — Rihanna featuring Calvin Harris

- "All of the Lights" — West featuring Rihanna and Drake
