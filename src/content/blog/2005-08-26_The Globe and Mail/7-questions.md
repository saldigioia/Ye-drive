# 7 Questions

## Producer and Rapper. Born June 8, 1977, in Chicago. Began Cutting Tracks Professionally at Age 20, and Was Discovered by Jay-Z’s Roc-a-Fella Records. Produced Hits for Jay-, Alicia Keys, Ludacris, Twista, John Legend and Others. Triple Grammy Winner, Including Two for His Solo Debut, the College Dropout.

Kanye West had been a big K name in hip-hop circles since producing Jay-Z’s 2001 hit Izzo (H.O.V.A.), but he didn’t become a household name until three years later, when his debut album, The College Dropout, topped critics’ polls and album charts, and won the Grammy for rap album of the year.

Apparently, that’s only the beginning. West was in Toronto recently to promote his second album, Late Registration, and made no effort to disguise his pride in the new album (which arrives in stores Tuesday). Co-produced with multi-instrumentalist Jon Brion, whose previous credits include albums by Fiona Apple and Aimee Mann, it abandons the hip-hop strategy of chopped beats and borrowed sounds for an approach West de- scribes as “cinematic,” employing everything from pipe organ and harpsichord to string sections and Maroon 5 heartthrob Adam Levine.

“I won’t say this is the future of music, but it’s going to be pretty hard to match it,” he says confidently.

**Jon Brion is notorious for telling an artist ‘you can do better’ and reworking tracks for months. Were you worried that you’d end up in that loop?**

No, because were the same people. I’m obsessive just like that, and we did take months on certain songs. But I love that. And he really pushed me. Otherwise, there would be no last verse on Gone — Jon begged for that. I love his feeling that you can always make it better. At a certain point, you have to stop and give the album to the release date. I’m still hearing stuff and thinking, I wish I could’ve done this, I wish I could’ve done that. But I’m pretty satisfied.

**You mentioned that you’re taking a big step forward, production-wise, for hip-hop. Why haven’t other people gone to this extreme?**

Well, there’s André 3000. He did [Outkast’s Speakerboxx/The Love Below] and it’s one of my favourite albums, but I don’t know if I can classify that as a hip-hop album. It’s not rap music. That’s some- thing else. Something amazing.

**On “Roses,” when you talk about when your grandmother was sick in hospital, you almost seem to be taking the Canadian stance that rich and poor are entitled to equal health care.**

I didn’t even know that. That’s funny! [laughs] Really, I’m arguing, [raps] You know the best medicine goes to people who’s paid. [speaks] And yet, in another year, I could have probably paid for my Gram, you know what I’m saying?

**”Crack Music” suggests that hip-hop is a way for African Americans to get real reparations. And here you are, signed to Roc-a-Fella and affiliated with Def Jam - both companies founded by black men. It’s not like the old days, when R&B labels were all run by whites.**

It’s funny you take it like that, because during the chitlin-circuit days, people would give their artists drugs, to lull them over and make them not think about their situation. And I’m saying, okay, let’s take it back to that. The line that touches on that is: ‘While our heroes and heroines got hooked on heroin. ... It was more thought- provoking than saying, ‘The CIA put drugs in the black community.’

**There was some amazement at the listening session when you said Radiohead and System of a Down are your closest competition. Why is there such incredulity when a rapper shows interests outside of hip-hop? Is it because so many hip-hop stars have such distinct personalities?**

Or just boxed-in personalities Like, Jay-Z, you’re gangsta rap. Or Mos’ Def, you’re conscious rap.

**Does that make it hard for a rap star to be an average person?**

I punch myself out of a box all the time. Even with the lukewarm success of Workout Plan in comparison with the previous songs, at the end of the day it gave me the leeway to come however I wanted. I can say, ‘It’s a celebration, bitches!’ and I think that would have been harder for people to take other- wise. You know, I’m taking off next summer to go and study poetry. Maybe it’s not anything I could learn in a crash two months or three months, but that’s what I’m going to do. Because there are so many things I want to touch on, and there are ways I think I can expand my mind lyrically.

**Poetry, huh? Who do you read?**

I don’t. I’d say I don’t read anything, other than in Stuff about Jessica Simpson. But Fiona Apple was tell- ing me about these books that break down the way certain words fit together. I’m looking into that.
