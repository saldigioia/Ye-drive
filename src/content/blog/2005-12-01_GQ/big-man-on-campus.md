# Big Man on Campus

## This Year, Kanye West Obliterated the Notion of a Sophomore Slump and Delivered the Most Daring Hip-Hop Record in Years. The Least We Could Do Is Find Clothes Plush Enough to Match the Man-Icy Cool Velvets, Cashmere, and Luxurious Corduroys That Stand Out in the Dark Days of Winter — As if Standing Out Was Ever Kanye’s Problem.

Given the delirious, boundary-burning success of his debut album, 2004’s The College Dropout, Kanye West could have spent this year skating on goodwill, pricing McMansions, and reading seripts for the inevitable rapper-turned-actor crossover attempt. Instead he made Late Registration, a record so inventive and thematically rich it justifies nearly every public pronouncement West has made about his own gifts — which is no small feat. Even talking trash about George W. Bush on national TV couldn’t slow his roll. So why, we wonder, is he so pissed?

”I’m, like, gonna kill my lighting guy,” he says, calling from the road a few hours before the third show of his Touch the Sky tour.

Kanye, Kanye, Kanye — whatever for?

“For being wack.”

But people have said good things about this tour, we point out. They have praised you and your touring ensemble — the seven-piece string section, the five-time-world-champion DJ, the backup singers. The wackness of the lights does not seem to have spoiled anybody’s Kanye experience….

“But I want everything to be perfect. I want to compete with those guys who have $200,000-a-week budgets for production — I wanna compete with U2. My goals are so lofty. Y’know, people say, ‘Kanye is so arrogant, Kanye is so arrogant. The only thing arrogant about me are my goals. If I said out loud what it is that I’m going for, people would just start laughing. Like, What the fuck is wrong with you?’ But when I made Late Registration, I was really listening to Songs in the Key of Life, saying, Yo, I’m gonna beat this album? I’m not saying I accomplished that, but that’s what I go in and shoot for. People ask me questions, about me, and they want me to give these cliched, false-modesty-type answers. But I refuse to lower my expectations or my goals to make them happy. It’s like the pretty girl in school who wears her hair ugly. Fuck that!”

But Kanye, this is America, where we think our celebrities are somehow capable of more awesome deeds than regular people; but weirdly, in return, we  expect them to insist that they re no better than anyone else.

”Yeah. And that’s not the case, obviously. This is Men of the Year!”

You’re probably the only guy in this issue who agrees with us that he deserves to be a Man of the Year. Are you amping up the bravado for our benefit, or do you really feel this way?

“I feel it ten times more than I’m saying.”

Us too! During a telethon to benefit victims of Hurricane Katrina, you went off-script and basically called the president a racist. How’d that work out for you?

“When NBC edited it out on the West Coast, that was a wake-up call. It let people know how censored we still are. This is supposed to be America, but you can’t get your opinion out. There’s all kinds of things I want to say, but I need to pace myself, to make sure that my opportunities to say these things aren’t taken away too abruptly.

“When I come out with a video, or with some music, I’m trying to make the world better. I’m trying to make the soundtrack to your life. I’m trying to make your summer more enjoyable. That’s my mission with music — before you even get into the ‘message’ aspect of it.”

The crazy thing about this is that somehow Kanye does not sound crazy. Late Registration really did soundtrack our lives and make our summer more enjoyable. We went to a wedding reception where the bride and the groom danced together to a song called “Gold Digger” shouting the line We want prenup! along with everybody else, then cracking up. We never would have gotten that moment, in a Kanye-less universe. And we knew Kanye probably had loftier things in mind, but still.

“Up to this point, what I’ve given the world is entertainment. Maybe after this point, I’ll be giving them inspiration. But I need really good people around me. If I do get to a point, hypothetically, where I’m more of a public speaker than an artist, I don’t want the lighting guy to fuck it up.”
