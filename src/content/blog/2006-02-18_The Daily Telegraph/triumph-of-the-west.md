# Triumph of the West

## Is There Anything That Rapper Kanye West Can't Do? He Doesn't Think So.

“People always say that you can't please everybody,” says Kanye West. “I think that's a cop-out. Why not attempt it? 'Cause think of all the people you will please if you try.”

Kanye West is the most important person working in popular music right now. In his own humble opinion, at least. Prior to the US Grammy awards earlier this month, the multi-award-winning, critically acclaimed, and hugely controversial American producer and rapper declared, “If I don't win Album of the Year, I'm really going to have a problem with that.” In the event, although he was nominated for eight Grammies and won three (including Best Rap Album for the second year in a row), the most coveted prize went to Irish rock band U2. West is absolutely convinced he lost on a technicality, with the black music vote split between his album and Mariah Carey's, on which he was one of the featured producers.

“I make categories where I'm up against myself!” he declares. “I definitely deserved Album of the Year. I'm not saying that I made the best album of all time, I'm just saying it was the best album this year.” He nonetheless declares himself philosophical about the result. “I've accomplished almost everything that someone can accomplish in music in less than two years, so it just gives me something else to do, to make a record that's so annihilating that there's no way that me and Mariah could get vote splitting.”

But it is true that West won Best International Male Artist at this week's Brits, that hip-hop is the dominant force in American pop culture, and that West is its most urgently contemporary talent. A Time magazine cover star, he produced groundbreaking hits for an A-list of R&B and hip-hop stars including Alicia Keys, Janet Jackson, Brandy, Jay-Z, and Beyoncé before stepping up to the microphone in 2004 for his lyrically and musically sensational debut album The College Dropout and last year's equally compelling follow-up, Late Registration. In two hugely productive years, the 28-year-old has notched up four million album sales and a slew of hits (including the epic gospel rap of Jesus Walks and the soulful groove of his Ray Charles sampling Gold Digger), while continuing to work as an in-demand producer (his protégé John Legend won a Grammy for Best R&B Album).

Musically, West has taken hip-hop back to its sample-driven roots, while simultaneously pushing outwards to new sonic horizons with daring time-shifting arrangements drawing on a vast range of sources. “I'm a popular artist but I'm a Pop artist too,” says West. “Usually Pop art samples things, Andy Warhol taking Marilyn or Kanye West taking Ray Charles and giving it a new form, a new shape and making it something the masses today will connect with.”

But he is also the cleverest and edgiest satirist in rap since Eminem, covering a huge range of social and political subject matter with a distinctive (and unusually eloquent and non-profane) mixture of anger, humor, and pathos. He has been bold enough to criticize hip-hop's bling culture on his Shirley Bassey-sampling Diamonds From Sierra Leone, but he saves his real fire for the lack of opportunities for those growing up on the wrong side of America's racial divide. On the confrontational Crack Music, he casts hip-hop as the black man's ghetto revenge on white America.

“I'll say things that are serious and put them in a joke form so people can enjoy them,” says West. “We laugh to keep from crying.” He is the polar opposite of hip-hop's current pin-up boy 50 Cent, the cartoon gangsta who revels in his own thuggishness. West's dress style is preppy and neat, his background solidly middle class (his mother was a professor of English, his father a former Black Panther turned pastoral counselor). But, beneath the smooth surface, the anger that motivates him draws on the same well of inequality as his more openly aggressive contemporaries.

“Real rap music is hard,” he says. “There's no great classic rap songs that weren't driven by aggression. I do feel angry about America, that's the way I was raised, but I still feel like America is the best country to live in. The opportunity is there, the American dream, you have people that've come from the lowest, the worst slums, to be millionaires.”

In September last year, during a televised benefit concert for Hurricane Katrina relief, West gave an impromptu speech about social and racial inequality, before concluding: “George Bush don't care about black people.” It was a soundbite that became central to the debate about the US government's response to the disaster. “I didn't feel like it would send shockwaves, it was just an emotional time,” mumbles West. He says his reputation

 for controversy is “just a by-product of being outspoken” and admits to discomfort over being drawn into the political arena.

“I don't do politics, I make music. I talk about things that are part of our lives but my movement is more social, my whole rap style is like dinner conversation, I just put it in a rap and give my opinion.”

West is very wary of the news media (this is the only interview he will give during his current UK tour) and complains about being misrepresented. “They throw you on the cover and then write what they want. They start putting you in a box.”

For someone whose public persona is based around an almost pathological egotism (he was photographed for the cover of Rolling Stone as Jesus wearing a crown of thorns, of which he says “I would never say I'm like Jesus, but we try to be like Jesus every day, so there's gotta be similarities”), in person there is little of the swagger his printed remarks often imply. In fact, he comes across as a bit of a nerd, and I wonder if his perceived arrogance is actually a result of a polite, middle-class boy's discomfort with rap's culture of braggadocio, and a consequent need to over-compensate.

“People always have these self-help books saying 'believe in yourself' and all that, but when somebody comes out and actually does do it, everybody says 'What's wrong with you?'” he says. West has an aversion to “fake Hollywood bullshit modesty” but insists that, in real life, he's “a humble person”. In his defense, he cites a creative process that is hugely inclusive, claiming to solicit opinions on his work in progress from everyone around the studio, musicians to security guards.

“The only thing really arrogant about me are my goals. I want to make an album that's better than Stevie Wonder's Songs in the Key of Life, I want to make something better than Marvin Gaye's What's Going On. Now I don't think I succeed every time, but if you shoot for the stars, you'll land on a cloud.”

Kanye West is currently on a sold-out tour of the UK. His new single 'Touch The Sky' is released on March 13.
