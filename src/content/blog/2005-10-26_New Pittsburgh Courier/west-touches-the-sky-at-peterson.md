# West Touches the Sky at Peterson

Kanye West is no politician.

In spite of the fact that the most talked about moment of his career came from the now infamous NBC Hurricane Relief Benefit Concert when he told a live audience “George Bush doesn’t care about Black people,” West made it clear to guests at a WAMO meet and greet session at Petersen Events Center on Sunday that he is “not into politics.”

While West scorns politics, he says he does not regret his outburst and will never shy away from addressing social issues in his music and his everyday life. The artist continued the effort to share his views with the “Touch the Sky” tour, which made a stop in Pittsburgh Oct. 23. WAMO-FM, who was instrumental in bringing the tour to the city, was on hand all day at Petersen collecting donations for hurricane survivors through Habitat for Humanity.

The tour, which initially featured West, Fantasia, Common and newcomer Keyshia Cole, kicked off Oct. 11 in Miami, Fla. Although the tour reached the city without rapper Common, the artists who remained made sure the audience was given more than their money’s worth for the show.

The show opened up with Keyshia Cole, who sang her latest singles, “I Should Have Cheated,” and “I Changed My Mind.” Cole, whose debut album “The Way it is” has drawn comparisons to the Mary J. Blige classic “My Life,” paid homage to the queen of hip-hop soul with her own version of the song “I’m Going Down.”

“American Idol” diva, Fantasia, followed Cole’s performance with a set of her most popular singles and some of her own favorite songs. Fantasia encouraged fans to become part of the show, from her pauses to hear the crowd sing the hooks to her songs “Truth Is” and “Baby Mama,” to her request for people to raise lighters and open cell phones during an illuminated performance of Aerosmith’s “Dream On.”

If anyone in the audience came because they knew West’s outspoken nature, comedic album skits and original style of hip-hop would make for a good show, they weren’t disappointed. West provided the audience with a visual and musical spectacle that covered singles from both his debut album “College Dropout,” and newest release “Late Registration.”

West utilized a number of props and images to enhance the show. The Chicago M.C. brought along a cast of live musicians, including a DJ, a drummer, a pianist and a string quintet-all of whom sat enclosed in transparent boxes sitting about three feet above the stage. The musicians became part of the multimedia presentation as shadows of them playing appeared through colored lights and as the barriers separating them from the audience doubled as video projector screens.

He opened the show with a video version of his “Late Registration” album skit, which featured the phony fraternity, “Broke Phi Broke,” a band of brothers united in their underemployment. From there, West found a number of ways to incorporate images and objects into each song he performed.

For the hidden track on “Late Registration,” or, “Late,” he was wheeled onto the stage in a bed and would peek out from under covers singing “I’ll be Late for That.” From there, he told the audience since he was already late he would “Drive Slow” to his job, the title of another “Late Registration” track. By the time “Drive Slow” was over, the stage was transformed to a phony GAP store and West had the perfect set-up for his “College Dropout” single “Spaceship,” which tells of West’s dream to escape his high stress/low paying job.

Remaining true to his goal to always speak from his heart, West revealed a great deal of what means most to him during his show. Before singing the song “Roses,” which he said he wrote while his grandmother “Chic,” was in surgery, he made it a point to explain how much she meant to him and how glad he was that she pulled through.

To spite critics who make it a point to dwell on his perceived arrogance, West projected a list of negative quotes written about him before performing the song “Bring Me Down,” simultaneously showing that while he won’t allow critics to affect who he is, he also isn’t immune to criticism.

While the show maintained a lighthearted tone overall, the audience was still shown the many faces of Kanye West, from his deep-thinking spiritual side, to his compassionate side and yes, his political side. When he came out in a Pitt t-shirt to perform the “College Dropout” hit single “All Falls Down,” he didn’t depart from politics when changing the words of one verse to “Drug dealers buy Jordans, Crack heads buy crack, and George Bush gets paid off of all of that.”

Although West wants to separate himself from the political arena, he made it clear during his show that he will not sacrifice his freedom to say what he feels about the world to do that. So as audiences for the “Touch the Sky” tour expect smooth R&B with a touch of hip-hop from Keyshia Cole and Fantasia, they should always expect to hear exactly what’s on Kanye West’s mind. And if politics happens to be what’s on his mind, then so be it.
