# Way Out West

## Rap's Hottest Producer Backs His Boasts by Cutting a Solo Album That's Both Urgent and Fun

Kanye West has been dubbed rap’s “next big thing” by a rackful of magazines and been tapped as producer-of-the-moment by a constellation of stars.

But is this enough for him?

Hardly. The celebrated producer-turned-rapper is miffed that some early reviews of his first solo CD, “College Dropout” — in stores Feb. 10 — gave him four stars out of five, and in one case, a B-plus.

“Are they kidding? B-plus? I’m the summa cum laude of this whole s--!” he says. “I’m changing the whole game. I’m changing the face of radio! I can’t even enjoy my own record because they just don’t get it.”

He can’t say the same about listeners. In the last few weeks, two songs produced by West became No. 1 hits: Alicia Keys’ ‘70s-style soul ballad “You Don’t Know My Name” and Ludacris’ zany “Stand Up.” West also has a current Top Five record with the rapper Twista’s blathery “Slow Jamz” and the top-rated video on MTV and MTV2 with his solo cut “Through the Wire.”

That last piece introduced West’s rapping talents to the world in a unique way. West cut it with his jaw wired stiff following a near-fatal car crash last year.

“I had plenty of painkillers,” he says.

That West would try to pull off his rap debut with half his face immobilized measures the depth of what he might call confidence and what others might call arrogance. Certainly, West won’t win any awards for modesty.

“My words are too colorful to be written in black and white,” he told the Daily News.

“My CD is so good, people will have to buy second and third copies because other people will be stealing them,” he later announced.

But if West, 26, comes off in interviews like a carnival barker, he’s far more serious on his CD. In fact, “College Dropout” is one of the most informed and political rap records since the heyday of Public Enemy and the Jungle Brothers.

“When I was a kid we had PE and the X-Clan,” West says. “It’s time now for that phase to come back.”

West’s rearing explains such worldly concerns — as well as his agile way with words. His father is a former Black Panther (now a Christian marriage counselor). His mom is a teacher who at one time headed the English department at Chicago State University. The name they gave their son means “the only one” in Swahili.

Growing up in Chicago, West says his father taught him to be hypersensitive to race. His mother played word games with him to increase his vocabulary. “I was taught to think on my own,” says West. “That’s what a lot of black kids don’t get.”

West’s talents got him a scholarship at Chicago’s Academy of Art but he dropped out when he found that the free ride only covered the first year. Then he went to Chicago State as an English major, but split when he realized hip hop was his calling. He chose to title his CD “College Dropout” as a joke on his past, but West is sincere in his belief that kids should “use school. Don’t let it use you.”

After leaving college, he produced some local rappers. But he didn’t get his first break until he sold a beat to Jermaine Dupree in 1998. West now says the track “sucked.” He applies the same description to his first attempts at rap. He considers producing easier.

“Anybody can make a good beat,” he says.

But they can’t make scores of them. West started racking up his hottest beats with Jay-Z, producing some of the best-loved songs on the rapper’s “Blueprint” album. Then the floodgates opened and he produced for Scarface, Talib Kweli, Foxy Brown, DMX and more than 40 others.

West developed a signature sound by speeding up old soul samples. The result made stars like Nina Simone and Chaka Kahn sound like chipmunks, but fans loved it.

Few hip-hop producers have successfully crossed over to become rappers. Even Dr. Dre lets other emcees outshine him on his solo cuts. Amazingly, “College Dropout” finds West spinning dense and clever rhymes that shuttle between socially conscious raps (in the Talib Kweli mold) and party anthems (in the Jay-Z tradition) as if there weren’t any difference.

“I believe in God, but I also like sex,” West says.

But he won’t indulge any gangsta cliches.

“I never killed anybody, so I don’t rap about it,” he says. “Every song [of mine] is an inspirational song, to make you feel good.”

Lately, West has been working with more mainstream artists. Upcoming projects involve Janet Jackson and R. Kelly. He says he’s open to producing any kind of music, naming the Red Hot Chili Peppers his favorite band.

Clearly, West sees no limits for himself in music — or in life. At a time when the jury is still out on his rap skills, West feels he already has the genre licked. “I’m going to have to start figuring out new goals,” he pledges.

Curing cancer, perhaps?

“That,” he says, “isn’t a bad idea.”
