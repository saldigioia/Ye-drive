# Kanye West, the O2, London

Few would have batted an eye had this gig, the first UK date on Kanye West’s Glow in the Dark tour, been cancelled. Hip-hop’s self- proclaimed saviour-genius is in mourning. Three weeks ago, his mother Donda died at the age of 58 from complications after cosmetic surgery. In Paris, he had almost curled up during “Hey Mama”, his maternal thank-you, unable to deliver lines such as “I appreciate what you allowed for me”. Here, until that track’s gaudy yet touching send-off, the show went on, and on.

West arrived in a beam of light, onto a stage that might have been a Star Trek set designed for the Pet Shop Boys. Violinists were enshrined at the foot of several sleek white pyramids; the band were body-armoured, like intergalactic riot police; behind them, a video screen pulsed digitised deep space. In the first of four costumes, West resembled Wesley Snipes from Blade, in a leather bomber jacket and high-tech specs. The rapper meant business, attacking the songs with brash, brisk vigour.

Most came from Graduation, his latest album. All three of his LPs toy with the fact he dropped out of college and is conflicted about pursuing stardom rather than his studies. Some critics are galled by his gross self-regard, but if West has his designer clobber and wears it, his ego dares to differ with the demands of the rap genre. At his best, he lays bare both the spiritual bankruptcy of bling and its shiny temptations — “To whom much is given, much is tested” (“Can’t Tell Me Nothing”) — and the idiocy of having to live up, or rather down, to the diktats of the street. Guilt-tripping himself, he was always mama’s, even grandmama’s, boy.

The finer points of his sentimental education were lost at the O2, as the prog-hop beats grew samey and portentous, but running a stadium-rap show is tough, like leading a mass exercise class. The cheesy samples of anthems such as “Touch the Sky”, “Gold Digger” and “Good Life” burnt off the stodge, however. And, after nearly two hours, West saved his best vocal — heartfelt but not effusive - for “Hey Mama”, as a video angel bade her farewell.

Finally, the Daft Punk-powered electro of “Stronger” sent the crowd into orbit. If West fell short of his supernova ambitions, he made a rocket-fuelled attempt.
