# Crushing on Kim

## More Than Friends? Kanye West Has Made It His Mission to Land the Unlucky-in-Love Kardashian

THE FRONT ROW at Kanye West’s March 6 Paris fashion show was packed with stars including Sean “Diddy” Combs, Alicia Keys and Vogue editor Anna Wintour. Then there was Kim Kardashian. Decked head to toe in pieces from the rapper turned designer’s line (including a pair of $6,OOO shoes!), “she flew in just to see him,” says a Kardashian pal. “Kanye begged her to come.” Their special connection was obvious at the show’s afterparty, held at VIP Room in central Paris. “They looked really close,” an eyewitness tells Us of the pair. “Like they really like each other.”

Well, maybe one more than the other. Sources say West, 34, is crushing hard on his longtime pal, 31. “Kanye is obsessed with Kim and would marry her,” a West source tells Us. For years, he’s had to make do with a flirty friendship. In December, the two were affectionate at an L. A. party — her first big outing after her marriage imploded. But now that Kardashian’s recent fling with ex Reggie Bush, 11, is kaput, the Kardashian source says, “Kanye is trying to woo her, telling her she’s the most beautiful woman ever. It’s no joke. He loves her.”

The hot pursuit of a megastar may be just what Kardashian needs. “Kirn’s had a really rough couple of months,” the Kardashian source tells Us, Indeed, her October split from her husband of 72 days, Kris Humphries, 27, has gone from civil to downright ugly: Last week, the exes even bickered over wedding gifts. Says the source, “The way the separation went down with Kris was horrible.”

The recent reunion with her on-and-off flame Bush, who flaunted a look-alike just two weeks after the pair reconnected, was another ego blow. “Kirn’s always the one doing the chasing,” the source reveals. Enter West. “To have Kanye charming her feels good,” says the source. “Guys are afraid to get near her with all the drama, and here’s a guy who’s actively pursuing her.”

Does West have what it takes? As a multitasking producer, hip-hop artist and fashion designer, West certainly understands Kardashian s nonstop lifestyle better than most. “He thinks she’s smart and a great businesswoman,” says the Kardashian source. “He envisions the two of them running this dynasty together.” And he’s already a fan of her close-knit clan: “Being an only child, he loves her big family.”

While the Kardashian insider insists the two are “just friends,” a second source is more coy, telling Us, “Kim is open to meeting new people and seeing what’s in store.” At least one friend sees the potential: “They have a fun, flirty rapport. It could be one of those things that’s just weird enough to work.”
