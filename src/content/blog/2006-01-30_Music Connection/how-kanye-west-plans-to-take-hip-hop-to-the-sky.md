# How Kanye West Plans to Take Hip-Hop to the Sky

Leave it to John Mayer, one of the myriad guests on Kanye West’s sophomore album, Late Registration, to give some perspective to the rap auteur and fellow hitmaker: “Failure does not exist in this guy’s mind, and he operates from that. It’s unbelievable.”

West, of course, has made plenty of believers over the years. As a producer, songwriter, and bona fide college dropout, the Atlanta-born Chicago-raised West made his behind-thescenes name with the likes of Jay-Z, Jermaine Dupri, Lil’ Kim, Da Brat, Alicia Keys, DMX, Talib Kweli, Twista, Mos Def, Common and Slum Village. Then came 2004’s College Dropout, which pushed West into his own spotlight with triple-platinum sales, a field-leading 10 Grammy nominations (he won two) and even a Best Male Video trophy at the MTV Video Music Awards for the hit “Jesus Walks.”

West has continued the success trend with Late Registration, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album sales chart last September and has passed the double-platinum mark, scoring more hits (“Diamonds From Sierra Leone,” “Gold Digger,” “Heard ‘Em Say,””Touch the Sky”) and snaring another eight Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year.

No stranger to hyperbole, West promised before its release that the album — with guest appearances by Mayer, Patti LaBelle, Maroon5 frontman Adam Levine, actor Jamie Foxx, Jay-Z, Paul Wall, Cam’ron, Nas, the Game and West protege John Legend — would “change the game, take hip-hop to the sky,” and it has proved to be both a qualitative as well as commercial triumph, with lush, layered soundscapes produced by West and Jon Brion. The album offers the kind of ambition associated with pop masterpieces like Pet Sounds and Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.

West, of course, will be the first to tell you about those merits, and his outspokenness including his proclamation that “George Bush does not care about black people,” during a Hurricane Katrina relief telethon last year) has generated a bit of ill will. But only a bit. You don’t have to look too hard to find folks who will give West his due as a genius — even without a diploma to verify it.

**MUSIC CONNECTION:** Was there a lot of pressure on Late Registration in the wake of College Dropout’s success?

**Kanye West:** I knew that after College Dropout I had the world listening. So what I had to do was not just outdo College Dropout and the accolades that it received. My [goal] was to make an album with no fast-forward material, ‘cause how often can you say, “I like every song on the album.” So it’s me up there, setting new goals for myself.

**MUSIC CONNECTION:** Late Registration has some of the epic production style that’s been associated over the years with people like Phil Spector and George Martin and Brian Wilson. What were some of the models you explored for Late Registration?

**WEST:** I remember one day just listening to the Jackson 5 for so long and hearing stuff where they didn’t bring drums in for two minutes. That would never happen in music today. [We used! Beatles joints, and there’d be random, modern shit we’d pop in. Stevie Wonder — there’s some blatant Stevie shit on [the album], like the strings at the end of “Hey Mama.”

**MUSIC CONNECTION:** How did Jon Brion get involved with the album?

**WEST:** I tried to call him. I tried to reach him. And all of these people wanted eril something out of this number; the second that Kanye West called, they’d say, “I could get you a beat” or “I could get you some money” or something for a fuckin’ phone number. I said, “Just gimme the number, man!” Then Rick Rubin, who actually still likes music and cares about the fans and has got enough money already, gave me Jon’s number. He also gave me (Maroon 5 singer) Adam Levine’s number when I lost it. I know that a lot of people, when they heard I was working with Jon Brion, they thought it was gonna be this ambient jazz kind of thing, but we turned the drums up louder!

**MUSIC CONNECTION:** Did you go into it with the intention of bashing those perceptions?

**WEST:** People would see that combination and they’d see Jon Brion as a regular white guy or whatever, and they’d see me and think I’m just a big-headed one-hit wonder, one-time rapper who wasn’t supposed to make it that far. They have no idea what’s going on. Jon had so much knowledge from the [pop] side and I had so much knowledge from the [rap] side, so it was just [an unfair criticism]. I just feel sorry for people now. ... And as for the fans of music, [the music I’m making] is the next level. It’s the next generation.

**MUSIC CONNECTION:** The song “Diamonds” was not an out-of-the-box smash when it initially came out. Did that concern you and did it make an impact on the rest of the album?

**WEST:** It was a wake-up call when there were certain black people who weren’t able to connect with the song “Diamonds.” I went back and re-did songs on the album and did the new songs and made the album blacker. I was feeling like, well, maybe all niggas don’t listen to Fiona Apple, like that, but they do listen to Curtis Mayfield, Otis Redding. The Blueprint, College Dropout, The Black Album all connected with black people in that way. So when “Diamonds” didn’t [hit] I said, “Man, I gotta make sure my niggas like this.” So it was a wake-up call for me in my career.

**MUSIC CONNECTION:** How so?

**WEST:** In my career, I’ve gotten offered all kinds of shit. Like Linkin Park; I personally like Linkin Park, but I ain’t rapping on it. I feel that I want to be the artist that’s really bringing the hood to the breaks, that’s really making, such as, “You motherfuckin” bad/Do your job and roll up/And watch how we roll up” and just sneak it into the Grammys, with a suit on. A lot of people, it seems they undermine black people to a certain extent, saying, “They’re not gonna like the instruments, because every other track out there is straight 808 drums” and blah, blah, blah. But that’s where we came from. Soul music is like that. The strings on (Late Registration) are truly black strings to me. They’re black. And it’s funny — Jon Brion did them, but he studied Motown. He studied all that [soul music), and he applied all that.

**MUSIC CONNECTION:** What kind of marching orders did you give to your writing collaborators on Late Registration?

**WEST:** Man, everybody that got on the record stepped to the plate. All you had to do was just play ‘em a little bit, they’d get scared, like, “Oh, I might not make this one.” And everybody stepped their game up a whole nother notch, whether they had to write a whole lot or whether it just came natural. Cam did his verse in 15 minutes, and other people wrote for months and months and months to get on it. But you was not getting on the alus invas pushing he avape. don’t want a flow I’ve heard before, y’know? Switch it up. Say something! 

**MUSIC CONNECTION:** There’s a lyric on the CD Late Registration about how “the powers that be won’t let me get my ideas out.” What is that referring to?

**WEST:** It was something I was going through during the record. That was the last rap that was written for the album. I had an idea and people would just go in and stop it, calling other people and not talking to ME about it, saying, “We’ll never do that, we’ll never do that.” I always have stuff that’s too racey and too cutting edge. People say, “That’ll be the end of your career,” blah, blah, blah. I remember when people said, “Jesus Walks’ is scary — It sounds nice, but it’s scary. We don’t know about that one.” But, of course, since I’m [called] “the first rapper who ever rapped about Jesus,” everybody wants to box me up. They want to act as if “Work Out Plan” wasn’t on the album. They want to act as if “Get ‘em High” wasn’t on the album. They’re saying, “No, you’re gonna be THIS for us. THIS is what you represent to us.” I say, “Nah, this is ME.” If the entire album is “Jesus Walks,” if the entire album is “All Falls Down,” if the entire album is “Never Let Me Down,” then what can you say? I want “Touch the Sky” and “Gold Digger” and “Drive Slow” and “My Way Home” and “Crack Music” — shit that’s this wide and this undeniable.

**MUSIC CONNECTION:** Do you like being involved in the business end of things?

**WEST:** Everybody’s telling me, “Hey, Kanye, start a label!” But there’s two things I enjoy the least - being signed and having to deal with that shit, and running a company and having to deal with THAT shit. I hate both things. Really, I’m an artist. I dig good music; what I bring to the table is vision for the artists. I’m like a stylist; I got my own styles, rhyming styles, and I can put artists in a certain light that way.

**MUSIC CONNECTION:** When you talk about taking hip-hop to the next level, how does that impact the way you want to market your music and present it in a live context?** 

**WEST:** I’m always thinking that way, man. We got some dates with U2, and I talked with Chris [Martin] from Coldplay for a while, “Man, I really want to go on tour with you.” It’s just me coming at it from a backpack level and nobody at the label believing in me and me having a lot [of shipments for College Dropout and selling out at Best Buy and having to pay for my first video and all that shit. So me getting the opportunity to be on tour with U2 or Coldplay is my ultimate goal. To be in, say, 60,000 seaters, that’s it, ‘cause we make 60,000-seater records.

**MUSIC CONNECTION:** What’s your measure of success?

**WEST:** It has to be playing in every car. Every house party, they gotta be playing “We Major” or playing “Gold Digger,” stuff like that. This album ended up costing double. had a million-dollar budget, and I was thinking I was gonna pocket half of that. The album ended up costing $2 million to make, so l’ve got to sell 2.6 million in order to recoup, just to break even.

**MUSIC CONNECTION:** What can you say about the next Kanye West album?

**WEST:** I’m gonna drop Graduation [this year]. [Late Registration] was just preppin’ y’all for that. I feel that lyrically I haven’t taken it to where I can go, so I’m gonna take off and actually have poetry lessons so I can figure out how to work my words better, my wordplay, and even speak from my soul more, ‘cause there’s poets that are killing me out there, content-wise. Their content is killing mine. If I can apply that to what I have, then we can take it to another level.

**MUSIC CONNECTION:** Are you working with Lauryn Hill on her next album?

**WEST:** I did something and she didn’t accept it. It wasn’t my best work. She’s got her own shit, you know. I turned down Ninth Wonder beats. I turned down Pharrell beats. Not that they weren’t any good; I just told them, “This is how I want my album to sound.”

**MUSIC CONNECTION:** Are there any beats you’ve given away over the years that you wish you’d kept for yourself?

**WEST:** Y’know, I want those people to have them. I could have them, but they could have them, too. So every beat I have out, [I wanted the artists to have it]. I want Slum Village to have it, I wanted Jay-Z to have “Lucifer.” I’m talking them into this shit; “I want YOU to have it. Go. Take it!”

**MUSIC CONNECTION:** What are some of your goals for the future?

**WEST:** Just something different, like movies or something. I’ll set new goals for myself now. I got the Grammys. I’m gonna win Album of the Year this year _ SV mean, what’s the competition. It’s like [Michael] Jordan; he just started setting new goals when the Bulls went for a record. That’s what I’m doing, too.
