# Kanye Celebrates New LP With Loose, VIP-Packed Club Gig

Kanye West’s surprise New York club show - to mark the release of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy - sold out within seconds. It's not every day, after all, that you get to see the planet's hottest pop star not named Lady Gaga play a venue no doubt smaller than his bathtub.

By midnight, the line outside the club stretched for blocks. Inside, Aziz Ansari, Ivanka Trump, Spike Lee and Diddy packed in elbow to elbow with fans. West walked on about 1 a.m. in a military jacket that suggested Napoleon Bonaparte via Jean Paul Gaultier. Manning three samplers mounted on white columns, he launched into the punishing two-note groove of "Dark Fantasy."

The show was loose, as though we were watching West goof around at home. He indulged his inner art rocker, building dense sample collages and restructuring songs on the fly. The guest list included Nicki Minaj, Rick Ross and Bon Iver's Justin Vernon, serving up thickly Auto-Tuned vocals.

At times, the show slipped into chaos. West botched lyrics and his guests missed cues. On the new album, "All of the Lights" is a hammering, brassy triumph, and it was triumphant here, too - until West cut it off halfway through, seemingly arbitrarily.

Such missteps did give the show an off-the-cuff rawness, nowhere in greater evidence than during West's closing 10 -minute rant, which touched on George W. Bush (unfairly "villainized"), Taylor Swift, and Matt Lauer's abusive interviewing techniques. In all, a tighter script would have helped: The errors made it hard to get swept away by any song for long. To be fair, the new album is full of ambitious music that's simply hard to pull off in a rock club. Often, though, West seemed guilty of a crime you'd never expect him to commit: giving his own songs short shrift.
