# Soul Survivor

The expertly blended Jackson 5 sample on Jay-Z’s latest banger, “Izzo (H.O.V.A.).” was a fitting choice by 24-year-old producer Kanye West — and not just because it created a hit. The track’s up-and-down bounce appropriately mirrors the roller-coaster nature of West’s own career.

Born and raised in Chi-town, West had a better upbringing than most, due in part to his Baptist counselor father and English professor mother. “I had a good childhood,” he reflects. “I learned the basic ideas of right and wrong that a lot of people I encounter don’t have.” West’s mom, who loved classic soul, encouraged him to play traditional instruments. But in the seventh grade, he fell in love with electronic instruments like samplers. Through a family connection, he met Common’s producer at the time, No I.D., and “bugged the shit out of” him until he taught West how to produce. Soon, West was selling beats to unsigned Chicago rappers for $50 a pop. Finally, West struck gold when local rapper Gravity copped a deal. West produced a few tracks on Gravity’s album, where he earned his biggest check at that point.

At the end of 1997, Columbia Records heard trademark soul-inflected beats and flew him to New York to discuss a deal. West didn’t get the deal, and Gravity’s career faltered. But his luck reversed when one of his managers got a job at Bad Boy. Bad Boy producer Deric “D-Dot” Angelettie began co-managing West and his beats starting really selling. He sold FoxyBrown the beat to her song “My Life” and did production on D-Dot’s The Madd Rapper album as well as producing Beanie Sigel’s first single, “The Truth.”

Dismayed that “The Truth” didn’t achieve crossover success, his manager told him to flip a more commercial script. West, who only sold five beats the year he produced “The Truth,” was hurt. “I should have been able to do at least five a month,” he says.

Luckily, he was able use his connects with the Roc-A-Fella camp to link with Jay-Z. Hence, one of the beats West sold in 2000, the soulful “This Can’t Be Life” from Jay-Z’s The Dynasty album, ultimately jump-started West’s career. Soon after, Jay-Z producer Just Blaze convinced West to move to New York. The heat of West’s beats and all of the networking caught fire, and he embarked on a selling spree, collecting checks from Nas, Ludacris and more. West also returned to previous customer Jay-Z with abeat tape. Five of the beats landed on Jay-Z’s opus The Blueprint, including “Izzo (H.O.V.A.). 

Now pollying to get on Nelly and Eminem’s upcoming albums, as well as trying to cop a rap deal, West knows those $250-a-track days are permanently behind him. “Earlier this year, I was selling beats for$500. Now, I’m on the phone with Jay-Z and Nelly,” he concludes with a grin. “I got the number one record in the country.

And, oh, if you wanted to buy a beat from Kanye West today, it’ll run you $30 G’s.
