# Natural Born Show-Off

Press playbacks tend to be uncomfortable affairs. A record label, eager to unveil its latest prestige release but terrified of a stray copy leaking on to the internet, invites reviewers to some well-appointed studio or office, where they frantically attempt to get the measure of the record in one listen while politely tapping their toes.

Understandably, most musicians would rather dine on broken glass than come and see critics marking their homework, but in this respect, as in so many others, Kanye West is not most musicians. That’s why, on a sunny afternoon in Los Angeles, the 28-year-old rapper-producer is holding court in some well-appointed studio and personally introducing a clutch of international journalists to his new album, Late Registration, the most anticipated hip-hop record of the year.

As a sound engineer triggers each track, West, wearing jeans and a grey hoodie, swivels to the music on a chair in the middle of the room. When he’s thoughtful, he chews on the cords of his hoodie. When he’s especially excited, he throws his hands above his head and sings along. This happens quite a lot.

Afterwards, he takes a few questions. An Australian woman asks if there is anyone in music he aspires to be like. “Yeah, me,” he shoots back, a smirk on his face. “Come on now! How could you be me and want to be someone else?” The Australian woman cannot say.

This is exactly the kind of lofty self-aggrandisement people have come to expect from the cockiest man in rap. West’s most outrageous exploits have been well-documented: how he walked out of the American Music Awards when he lost best new artist to country singer Gretchen Wilson (“I was the best new artist this year so get that other bullshit outta here”); how he declared, “Anyone who doesn’t give [his debut album, The College Dropout] a perfect score is lowering the integrity of the magazine”; how, most recently, he suggested to stunned journalists that they should pay for the privilege of having him on the cover.

After the playback Q&A, addressing an audience of one, he’s more muted. He claims that he meant every star should be paid, not just him, but the comment achieved its aim: more publicity. “Earlier today I said a lot of things but those cocky-sounding statements just look better in black and white. That’s why they always use them. And I always give it to them. That’s why my interviews are so valued. That’s why I should get paid.” He giggles softly, pleased with his irrefutable logic. “That’s perfect!”

So does he think he gets enough credit now? “Because I talk so much shit they give me overcredit just to shut me up!” But does he think his tireless trash-talking has backfired on him at all? “Not as much as it helps,” he smiles. He still bears the effects of a near-fatal car accident three years ago: his jaw is a little puffy, his diction slightly slurred.

If anyone in hip-hop has the right to blow his own trumpet right now, it’s Kanye West. Even before the release of The College Dropout last February, he was one of the industry’s hottest producers, finessing accelerated soul samples into sugar-sweet hits for the likes of Jay-Z and Alicia Keys. The College Dropout, however, was something else entirely: a sprawling, hubristic masterpiece that wowed award panels (it won three Grammys and three Mobos), critics (it topped the Village Voice’s prestigious year-end poll) and record-buyers (three million and counting) alike.

It’s the contradictions that make West so compelling. He psychoanalyses African-Americans’ love of bling (“things we buy to cover up what’s inside”) while wearing a diamond-encrusted Jesus pendant and commissioning a replica of the Sistine Chapel fresco for his Los Angeles home. He rubbishes higher education while flaunting his own intellect. He lays bare his shortcomings even as he sings his own praises. More than any other rapper, West embodies the oppositions that rack hip-hop’s body politic: art versus commerce, innovation versus mainstream success, social conscience versus ego and ambition. West believes that if anyone can bridge those polar divides, he can – he wants it all.

Whether he will get it depends on the reception to Late Registration, the second in a planned tetralogy of education-themed albums. His key inspirations were Fiona Apple’s Tidal and Portishead’s Dummy so he approached Jon Brion, Apple’s producer and a respected soundtrack composer, to co-produce the record. His other recent passions are also out of the hip-hop loop, including Franz Ferdinand, director Michel Gondry and whitebread singer-songwriter John Mayer.

The vaultingly ambitious Late Registration places West alongside OutKast in the front rank of hip- hop’s envelope-pushers. ‘Celebration’, during which he instructs a sidekick to pour everyone in the room a glass of champagne, recalls the lavish 1970s psychedelic soul of Rotary Connection; ‘Gold Digger’, which features both a Ray Charles sample and a snatch of actor Jamie Foxx impersonating Charles, employs some of the vintage synthesizers pioneered by Stevie Wonder; ‘Gone’ leaves hip- hop behind entirely during its orchestral climax.

“If I can go back and use this played-out word for a second, there’s no bigger form of bling than this,” says West with a satisfied grin. “There is nothing more stuntastic than rapping in front of an orchestra.”

Hearing West explain his own record is an educational experience, not just because he supplies so much detail that he might be dictating the York study guides to Late Registration, but because he has so little interest in maintaining mystique; he painstakingly elaborates every pun and describes his use of pop culture references as “the Eminem theory”. He may have dropped out of Chicago’s Columbia college after his first semester and an English course at Chicago State after one year, but he’s a diligent student. And he’s not willing only to present the end result; he needs to show off his workings in the margin.

“I’ll take opinions from anyone from Jay-Z to a janitor, and I might value the janitor’s opinion more,” he says. “I want it so no one can front on it. People say you can’t please everyone all the time. I don’t believe that. I think you can. I’m not like, ‘Oh I’m Kanye West.’ I’m like, ‘Oh you don’t like it? Oh wow!’ To the point where I know you have to like it.”

To this end, he is an incorrigible tinkerer. Last November, West told MTV that Late Registration was 75% finished; eight months later, it has changed almost beyond recognition. Take his recent Shirley Bassey-sampling single, ‘Diamonds From Sierra Leone’. It started life as simply ‘Diamonds’, a chest- puffing anthem for Roc-a-Fella, the label that signed him, and a whirlwind summary of his own achievements: “I forgot better shit than you ever thought of.”

But then Q-Tip, the former member of A Tribe Called Quest who guests on Late Registration, alerted West to the issues surrounding conflict diamonds. Having boned up on the subject, West promptly changed the title and themed the video accordingly but it was too late to alter the lyrics. The result is a curious compromise, a protest song in name only, although West proudly reveals that his jeweller has had to inform his customers that none of his wares are from Sierra Leone.

Diamonds has been a headache for its maker, too. Negative reactions from West’s core fanbase stung him into dropping four of the album’s more outré songs, including one that features John Mayer and a harpsichord, and replacing them with more conventional hip-hop tracks. Never one to understate his case, he proclaims on the crunching, martial ‘Crack Music’: “This is black music, nigga!”

“All this is saying is, OK I see now, the ‘hood does not quite want Shirley Bassey yet, so let me still give them this. ‘Crack Music’ was made after ‘Diamonds’. After black people were like, ‘I don’t know about this one.’ It was like me reaching too high for the cookie jar.”

West, whose first name is Swahili for “the only one”, has been reaching for the cookie jar all his life. When he was in kindergarten, one teacher told his mother: “Kanye certainly doesn’t have any problem with self-esteem, does he?” A few years later, another teacher would scold: “This isn’t meant to be the Kanye West show.” West titters at the memory. “My parents would say, ‘Why are you such a ham?’ I was made to show off. I was born to stunt.” Were other kids jealous? “Um, yeah. How did you know?”

Whereas most rappers have limited opportunities for travel before getting signed, West was always aware of the wider world. Born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago, he accompanied his mother, an English professor, on a year-long work trip to China when he was 10. Equally formative, he says, were the summers he spent with his father, a Black Panther turned pastoral counsellor, in Maryland and Washington DC. “Just having to speak to people and learn a different dialect. That’s what I try with my music - this will affect more people if I word it like this.”

Is that because you want to be liked by everyone? “Yeah, maybe it is. It’s maybe the trademark of a show-off.” Not necessarily, I say. Some show-offs only want to be noticed rather than liked. “Those are assholes,” he cackles.

Compared with the bone-deep self-assurance of his label boss, Jay-Z, West’s combative egotism only thinly conceals layer upon layer of insecurity and doubt. Why else would his lyrics on The College Dropout be so obsessed with his struggle for recognition? And why would he keep asserting how wonderful he is if he weren’t terrified of the alternative?

“Yeah that’s definitely true,” he concedes. “Really good people like me are scared of falling off. I’m totally scared of falling off. Just imagine it. Just imagine if I woke up one day and I was wack. What would I do then?” He lets the question hang in the air while we both ponder this dreadful scenario.

The chips on West’s shoulders developed during his long, slow climb up the hip-hop ladder. Back in 1996, when he left college to pursue music, he couldn’t get arrested. He blew an interview with Mike Mauldin at Columbia records by announcing his ambition to overtake R&B kingpin Jermaine Dupri, oblivious to the fact that Dupri’s real surname is – oops – Mauldin.

Even when Jay-Z took him on as a producer in 2001, he was regarded as having ideas above his station. Hip-hop is one of the few fields in which a privileged background and preppy dress sense will make you an outsider. “I used to always feel awkward around a lot of rappers. Other people came from hustling and all that. Sometimes it was harder to relate. People would look down on me for the way I dressed, because my raps weren’t really that good – it was like, ‘Just shut up and do beats.’ “

He admits that his doubters had a point. When he signed to Roc-a-Fella as a solo artist, his first public outing was inauspicious. Performing a few verses with Jay-Z in Chicago in September 2002, he was an embarrassment. He spent the next year slaving over his rhymes until he was up to scratch. “There’s nothing I really wanted to do in life that I wasn’t able to get good at. That’s my skill. I’m not really specifically talented at anything except for the ability to learn. That’s what I do. That’s what I’m here for.”

I ask him to tell me one thing he’s bad at. Nine seconds tick away while he searches for an answer. “Come on, man! That’s the hardest question anyone’s asked me.”

One flaw he will admit to is a short attention span. After half an hour, his gaze is wandering to his laptop screen, where he peruses the work of Waspy American painter John Currin and double-checks his own album artwork. Fighting the urge to slam the laptop shut on his fingers, I remind him of something he told Radio 1’s Tim Westwood last month: that the three words that summed up his life were “Louis [Vuitton], porn and church”. I ask which one takes up the most time. He laughs. “Well, I spend more time watching porn and praying about it afterwards. Then I’ll put on some Louis Vuitton and leave.”

Then, a little guiltily, he admits that he doesn’t enjoy church. “I had to go when I was a shorty and it was just mad boring to me.” So how religious is the man whose most acclaimed hit to date is the strident, gospel-powered Jesus Walks? “I guess I’m religious because I really do believe that Jesus died for our sins,” he muses. “But that’s because it was instilled in me. If I had been raised as a Muslim I wouldn’t believe that Jesus died for our sins.”

Anyway, West’s faith was not a priority until the night in October 2002 when his Lexus smashed into another car. During his recovery, wittily detailed on his hit single ‘Through the Wire’, he became convinced that God had saved his life.

Does he ever wonder why God spared him rather than any of the 42,815 Americans who didn’t survive their traffic accidents that year? “Hmm.” He pauses and looks away. His answer sounds more like a question. “He still had a job for me? He’ll just have me do stuff and I wasn’t planning on it. In certain situations he just talks through me.”

West’s ambitions certainly have a messianic tint. During the playback he airily announces: “I’m the closest that hip-hop is getting to God. In some situations I’m like a ghetto Pope.” If that seems like a tall order, then so is his ambition to redefine hip-hop and “achieve something completely new”. If he fails, it won’t be through a failure of nerve. Years after his teacher told him otherwise, it is finally the Kanye West show.

“How ill is it to have someone that talks that much shit and then backs it up?” he asks, leaning forward in his chair, a thrilled grin illuminating his face. “And what if I didn’t back it up? How exciting would that be, also? It’s like I’m walking on this tightrope. It’s like the reason why you go to a circus – it’s more entertaining. It’s like, damn, what if he falls? And if I do make it, it’s like, damn, he made it! But either way you’re saying ‘damn’. Everybody else is just walking on the ground.”
