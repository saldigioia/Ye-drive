# An Album and Its Buzz

Welcome to 2011, a year that — once the last of the snow is scraped away — will bring new hope, the promise of renewal, a chance to wake up in a world in which Kanye West’s “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy” is not the consensus pick for album of the year.

Its reign has been tyrannical — surprisingly, less because of Mr. West’s maniacal and loud sense of self-importance than because of the unimaginative group-think the album has spawned. In the waning weeks of last year it was hard to read about music without being assured that this album, Mr. West’s fifth, was a world beater. It topped lists. It received perfect scores. It got “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy repealed. (That was Lady Gaga actually.) It secured passage of the Dream Act. (Actually, not even this album was powerful; maybe his “Late Registration” could have done it.)

Lack of superpowers aside, “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy” (Roc-A-Fella/Def Jam) remains, six weeks after its release, a phenomenal album, third on my own year-end list, textured enough to still be revealing new crannies upon repeated listens, and alluring enough still to warrant those repeated listens.

But consensus is less a measure of greatness than of social climate. And when the year-end lists of several prominent outlets with different demographics and agendas — the magazines Rolling Stone, Vibe and Spin; the Web sites Pitchfork and Stereogum — share the same winner, it almost certainly indicates intangibles at play. Blessedly there was no consensus on No. 2: the Black Keys, Rick Ross, Deerhunter, LCD Soundsystem and Arcade Fire each got a nod. But that reflected a lack of other widely agreed upon ambitious albums; maybe Mr. West was a titan in an off year.

More vexing were some of the ratings, with outlets falling over themselves to grant Mr. West a top score: a rare 10.0 at Pitchfork, a slightly less rare 5 stars at Rolling Stone (which also gave that rating to his second album, “Late Registration”), an A from Entertainment Weekly (in fairness, a not infrequent grade at that magazine). And so such reviews are bones dropped for approval by tail-wagging puppies.

These ratings and rankings make a statement about not only the presumed quality of the album, but also about institutional decisions regarding an artist’s worthiness, and about those institutions’ desire to be seen acknowledging an artist’s worthiness. Enjoying an album is a private, micro affair; certainly not everyone on the staffs of those publications felt that Mr. West’s album was the best. But advocating for it is a macro decision, carrying the weight of many — and by extension, all, not one.

Mr. West received these simultaneous accolades for several reasons. There’s the recent egalitarian streak in pop criticism — the death of nongeneralists — even if this specific embrace of Mr. West is merely a case of exceptionalism masking as democracy. “Twisted Fantasy” is a hip-hop album accessible to both insiders and outsiders, arriving in a moment in which other genres are as open-armed as ever. Since his debut album Mr. West has boldly asserted his primacy, demanding that others — critics, award shows, other artists — fall in line. By asking to be judged at a higher level Mr. West implicitly allows for it by creating the language for that acclaim. And maybe in some way fear plays a role, with institutions worried that history will not smile on dissenters.

Mr. West also spent months doing things critics like: using the Internet to reveal his inner self, which, it turned out, was pretty much the same as his outer self; giving away music; and providing a peek into his methods in the process.

Finally, and most boringly, year-end lists often favor late-year releases, when the sense of anticipation fulfilled is still fresh. In this regard music critics are no better than Oscar voters. The last thing they remember as they fill out their ballots is the triumph of Mr. West’s album, or reading about someone else’s insistent perspective on the triumph of Mr. West’s album, or assuming — rightly, at it happens — that for the next few weeks before the actual year’s end, nothing they or anyone else will do will detract from that triumph, or perception of triumph.

Having such strict agreement among critics is a bit like letting the blind judge a beauty pageant: the results are sometimes unreliable, and even less translatable to the world at large.

On the most recent Billboard album chart “Twisted Fantasy” is No. 19; the majority of albums above it had been commercially available as long or longer. (The same is true even when the chart’s three holiday albums are excluded.) More tellingly, Mr. West has no song in the Top 75 pop singles — “Runaway” is No. 76, and “Monster” is No. 100. “Twisted Fantasy” may become Mr. West’s first album without a Top 10 pop single. Perhaps all the critical love has turned it into a cult album.

“My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy” may or may not have been the best album of 2010. Believe what you will. Either way it’s not even the best Kanye West album. So now what — turn it up to 11.0? Plead for extra credit? Develop a new ranking system?

Mr. West’s next album can only be a disappointment, a step down from the perfect ratings and universal acclaim he’s been openly craving since the beginning of his career and has finally wrested from the last constituency most people look to for approbation: critics.

Now that the ballots have been counted and the legal challenges purged from the court system, Mr. West is free to misstep — or, rather, to misstep egregiously in a way that can’t be written off as part of his eccentric, sometimes galling genius. He made a terrific album, but mainly he avoided doing things that critics wouldn’t like. (Nonetheless there was still the occasional churlish dismissal of the music based on the absurdity of the man.)

Late last week an unfinished cut of the video for “Monster,” one of the most lauded tracks from “Twisted Fantasy,” leaked online. It opens with a woman, dangling by her neck from a chain, lifeless down to her peep-toe pumps. Later Mr. West raps, in bed, next to a pair of limp women. It’s a grotesquerie, far beyond the slaughter for sport one might expect of a horror film, the obvious touchstone. (The video may be the antithesis of his collaboration with the artist Vanessa Beecroft two years ago for the release of “808’s & Heartbreak.”)

It’s hard not to think of lynchings, of sexual violence. It’s hard not to feel a little nauseous, and a lot sad. The video is empty provocation and clumsy art, the move of someone who, in a climate of unchecked glorification, has been given too much rope to play with. Maybe not enough for a backlash, but had this video been released four weeks ago, certainly enough to get some people to change their votes.

And yet for all intents and purposes it’s a 2011 problem, likely to be forgotten by December. No one will place an asterisk next to Mr. West’s 2010 wins. History is his.
