# Kanye West Closes Coachella 2011

About halfway through Kanye West’s headlining set at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, he took a few moments to address the crowd.

West said his Coachella performance was the most meaningful one since his mother passed. “To see all of you who still love me... to have fans that were here since ‘Through the Wire.’ I really appreciate y’all tonight.”

You might think that’s just politeness, but anyone familiar with West’s public persona knows that he speaks his mind, filter free, and deals with the consequences later.

The rapper puts everything on the table: his grappling with religion, unyielding materialism, massive ego and crippling self-criticism.

On a moving platform tens of feet over the crowd, Kanye began his set with “Power.” Dancers moved to opera on the stage before Kanye made his bold entrance. He sang the song from the pedestal, with fireworks going off behind the stage.

He’s not afraid to make a scene, of this we can be sure.

West’s set cherry picked hits from “The College Dropout” to “My Dark Twisted Fantasy.” It not only showed his musical evolution, but how much he’s changed and gone through since first hitting big.

“Jesus Walks,” “Touch the Sky”and “Gold Digger” took us back to a few years ago. Before Kanye’s mother died, and before he and his girlfriend broke up. “Heartless” took us through his rough breakup, from “808s & Heartbreak.” And reconciling his ego with his shortcomings with “Runaway,” from his latest record.

Over the last few days, chatter abounded as to who might join Kanye during his set. The obvious choices were: Katy Perry for “Extraterrestrial,” and Rihanna for “All of the Lights.” The dreamers crossed their fingers for a Daft Punk cameo. But nobody had much luck.

West had two guests perform with him: Pusha T from Clipse, who guest rapped during “Runaway,” and Justin Vernon of Bon Iver, who sang throughout the set.

“Hey Mama” ended the night on a highly emotional note. “This show is dedicated to you, mama,” West said.

He took a bow along with all of the dancers and performers who contributed to his set, and the show was over.
