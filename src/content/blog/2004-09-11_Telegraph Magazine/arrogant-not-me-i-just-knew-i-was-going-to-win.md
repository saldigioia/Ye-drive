# "Arrogant? Not Me. I Just Knew I Was Going to Win…"

Ohio State University is marching to the beat of a college dropout. Not just any college dropout mind, but rapper and producer Kanye West, who frantically paces the stage, reciting the lyrics to his song ‘Jesus Walks’ as if his life depended on it.

The track (released as a single in the UK last week) details the rapper’s battle to balance the temptations and demands of his secular lifestyle with his spiritual beliefs. This being the Midwest, it’s not surprising that the song strikes a chord. The all-ages crowd, racially-mixed but largely female fans of tonight’s headline act Usher, are on their feet stamping, waving and singing along to every word.

West has single-handedly turned the atmosphere in the Schottenstein Center sports arena into something resembling a revival meeting. The impression is amplified by He’s wearing a starched white Burberry suit. A pendant hanging around his neck – $25,000 gold and diamond pendant crafted into the shape of Jesus’ head – glints in the light as he moves.

One senses that the irony of him returning to college to raise the roof on campus would be not lost on West. This, after all, is a man who’s not shy of proclaiming his importance to the world, even appending an eight minute monologue to his album that outlines in agonising detail exactly how he made the grade as a superstar rapper-producer from humble beginnings as a youth daydreaming of fame on Chicago’s South Side.

The success of West’s debut album, College Dropout, which has sold in excess of three million copies worldwide since its release in February, has turned him into the de facto leader of the new school in hip hop, an eleventh hour intervention has injected a dose or reality and light-heartedness into a genre that seems content to peddle gun-toting urban fantasies as long as the money keeps rolling in.

Even the way West dresses marks him out. He favours the preppy look of khaki slacks and collegiate sweaters. Post show in West dressing room, several members of his entourage (which includes his personal barber) sport the Louis Vuitton backpacks with which he has become associated with, that signify his desire to draw a connection between the campus and the street corner.

“I’m not really a conscious rapper,” he says. “I’m just a regular person, even though I have a good- ass job. And regular people have a conscience. Their lives are so much more interesting than performer’s.” As West talks, he is simultaneously tapping away on a Gameboy Advance and keeping one eye on a man sitting next to him, who’s mocking up a logo for West’s record label Good Music on a laptop.

“What’s a performer’s life?” he continues. “I went and bought a Benz today! The things that regular people go through – love, pain, work, dreams – that’s real.”

The joy of listening to College Dropout is that makes no attempt to participate in largely-fabricated milieu of ghetto hardship that most commercial rap posits itself. The struggle here is as much internal as external, as if West is engaged in a dialogue with himself, growing into an understanding of the ways of the world through his own mundane life experience. Spaceship talks about working by day as the token black youth working at The Gap, and crafting beats by night that can take him away. As often as not he uses humour to more effectively get his message across. ‘The New Workout Plan’ is a deft parody of aerobics exercise tapes that mocks the lengths young black women will go to snag a successful man.

Musically, the record is a modern take on classic ‘60s soul and gospel with, in equal measure, enough bounce to move the dancefloor and melody to entice the masses – a sound that has become West’s hallmark as a producer.

Outside of work, West favours listening to rock over hip hop. He recently admitted a fondness for Franz Ferdinand. “But my all time favourite group is Red Hot Chilli Peppers,” he says, before bursting into a few bars of ‘By The Way’. Much of the backstage banter between West and his Canadian tour A-Trak, a prodigious Jewish-Canadian DJ from Montreal with a seemingly encyclopaedia knowledge of hip hop, centres around rap trivia.

“What’s the greatest hip hop beat of all time?” West proffers. But in this instance A-Trak doesn’t get a chance to respond before the producer provides the answer: “Puffy. ‘All About The Benjamins’.”

Conversation turns to the news that West has just been nominated for seven MOBOs in the UK, the most for one artist in the history of the ceremony.

“You mean to say, I got nominated for the most awards and I ain’t even dropped ‘Jesus Walks’ yet!” he exclaims with mock astonishment.

“If I ever said some asinine shit like, ‘Yo, I’m gonna get nominated for the most awards ever,’ people would just say I’m arrogant statement? But the whole thing is I’m not,” he says. “All I do is work with people who don’t believe.”

Finding a vein in the conversation that he can warm to, he stops tapping on the console, looks up and focuses his entire being on making himself understood. “I don’t see what’s wrong with saying, I’m going to sell three million records. What if someone was like, ‘I-am-GOING-to-finish-school’!”

He slams his fists in the air as he fires each word out. “Not even saying ‘I want to’ but ‘I am GOING to’, in order to give themselves that confidence. And people turn around and say they’re arrogant?”

He pauses, cocks his head and resumes, gradually working himself into a frenzy.

“Now they’re doubting. They’re saying, first of all, you can’t do it. And secondly, you’re method – to build your esteem up so that you have something to believe in and set your goals – is wrong too. So they bashing you on both ends. It’s basically like saying, ‘Fuck you! You have to be a fucking loser! You can’t believe that there is something greater for you out there. Oh, he’s so arrogant! He has dreams. Why the fuck should he dream? And if he does dream, don’t let him say it loud!’”

When he says this what is perceived as arrogance and conceit by his detractors comes across more as intense self-belief, confidence and drive, a by-product of his bold admission (on his previous Top 10 hit, ‘All Fall Down’) that he’s ‘so self-conscious’. And, perhaps, all the larger-than-life facets of his personality are due to the fact that he’s an only child.

His parents separated when he was three. West lived mostly with his mother, an English Literature professor at Chicago State University, and the holidays with his photojournalist father in Atlanta. Aged ten, he spent a year in China, when his mother took up a teaching position in Nanjing.

“I think that got me ready to be a celeb because, at that time, a lot of Chinese had never seen a black person. They would come up and stare at me, rub my skin, fishbowl me.”

Undaunted, he took advantage of his otherness by breakdancing on the streets for spare change. “Oh, how did you know that?” he says, genuinely surprised when asked about the story. “Scotland Yard would love to get their hands on that piece of evidence.” He pauses. “Where that come from?” He looks around for an answer but no one knows. “Austin Powers.”

At times when the conversation in the room drops, or whenever West gets bored with the line of questioning, West seems compelled to fill the void with his presence by spouting lines of movie dialogue, the origin of which seems to confound his associates. (“I love Ben Stiller and Adam Sandler movies,” he says.)

Where he’s got to in life is in large part due to where he’s come from. “My grandfather, my father and my mother were all activists,” he says. “My grandfather was the original hustler. He shined shoes and did whatever he had to do to send all his kids to college. If that ain’t a hustle, what do you call it.”

In the 70s, his father briefly became involved with the Black Panther Party, speaking at rallies. “He was a military brat who grew up in Germany as a black kid among white folks. So he was looking for a place to fit in, to be a part of a movement, a struggle. And they accepted him.”

West went through similar struggle to find acceptance himself, striving for years to become accepted as a rapper. “No one really wanted to produce when I was young. I was trying to rap. And I made beats because what else was I going to rap on? Other people’s beats.”

At the same time he pursued an academic career, attending first art college and then Chicago State University as an English major, where his mother headed up the English Department. “Most of the time I’d be in music class or in the lunch room talking to girls,” he shrugs. When he did decide to drop out after a year and a half of study, he already had a production deal on the table from Columbia Records. His got his first break as a producer through the patronage of Jay-Z (who used several of West’s tracks for his 2001 album The Blueprint).

West eventually signed with Jay-Z’s label Rocafella as an artist in his own right. But in October 2002, before he was even able to drop a note, the producer was engaged in a head-on collision after leaving the studio late one night in his car. His jaw was fractured in three places. (In the remix to ‘Jesus Walks’, he admits for the first time on record that he fell asleep at the wheel; a confession that could cost him dearly given that the other driver involved is currently attempting to sue West for compensation.)

He turned the accident, which could have derailed his rap career, into his calling card, leaving his hospital bed to lay down his first single, ‘Through The Wire’, literally through gritted teeth as his jaw was still wired shut. And when the album was leaked onto the internet three months before its release, he took it as a challenge, re-recording the vocals on all but one track and adding four new songs. He gives the impression that nothing can dent his inestimable reserves of self-confidence, a quality he says has been with since childhood.

“We used to have these talent shows at school,” he recalls, composure regained, “and I would help the others because I just knew I was going to win anyway. The teachers used to say, ‘This ain’t meant to be the Kanye West show.’ But now they can’t stop me. It’s all in the fans hands.” He pauses, then lets out a self-satisfied guffaw. “Y’know, I can be dead-ass serious but, at the same time, I say a lot of stuff just ‘cos it sounds fun.”

And with that he returns to his Game Boy, safe in the knowledge that his eleventh hour intervention may yet provide a light-hearted redemption from the tyranny of hip hop’s poker-faced hard men.
