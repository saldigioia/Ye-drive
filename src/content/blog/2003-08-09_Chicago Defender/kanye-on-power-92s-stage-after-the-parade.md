# Kanye on Power 92’S Stage After the Parade

With an invincible drive, Roc-a-Fella’s finest new family member Kanye West reveals how his pathway to an accomplished life, love, and success are critical to the glory of his victory.

Kanye West, a 26-year old Chicago native is on his way to staking a solid claim as one of hip-hop’s elite. He is the new sound, style and culture of today’s hip-hop.

Blessed with a creative passion set aside for a chosen few, the producer/rapper has a gift so powerfully instinctive that it is as natural to him as the air he breathes.

Kanye exudes this gift through his being and becomes it. This is the intensity for which he reveres his emotion for life; the people in his corner, and of course his music.

He got his start back in the third grade when he discovered his passion, writing and rhyming. He progressed and began making beats when most kids were still playing hide and seek on the playground. His favorite past time became an occupational goal as a teenager when he came across NO I.D. a Chicago beat mastering producer who at the time produced an up in coming rapper who at the time went by the name Common Sense (now Common).

This was a chance encounter that would become the pivotal opportunity to shape his future career in music. NO I.D. encouraged Kanye to sample from soulful old school hits and revive them with a new school flavor. In a MTV interview,

Kanye explains, “NO I.D. told me ‘you need to sample off records’ when I found that out, it was all over.”

Kanye was signed to ROC-A-FELLA in 2002; the reality of a fathomable vision finally came in to view. Several big name labels had courted him at the time including Cash Money Millionaires, but the R-O-C” had the stepping-stone he was looking for.

Rather than his wildest dream come true, Kanye saw this as a calculated step to achieve the goals he had implemented for himself. “I am always confident in myself,” he tells an MTV reporter.

This is also the unwavering confidence he fiercely brings in to the ring to fight for an MC heavyweight title. This direction was put on the back-burner for while but he always intended to step in the studio as an artist once his career as a producer took off.

Kanye focus is to establish himself as a dynamic one man, bringing the rhymes and the rhythm with innovation and originality.
