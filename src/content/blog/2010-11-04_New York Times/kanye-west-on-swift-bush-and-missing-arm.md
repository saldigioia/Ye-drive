# Kanye West on Swift, Bush and Missing Arm

If Kanye West really wanted to astound us maybe he would have spent Election Night at home watching returns and waiting to see if the Republicans retook the House of Representatives. Instead, hip-hop’s answer to Zelig took a slightly less surprising route: on Tuesday night Mr. West spent several hours on New York’s Hot 97 radio station (97.1 FM), fielding questions from the host Funkmaster Flex in a rollicking and candid interview.

Needless to say, it did not take long for Funkmaster Flex to bring up Mr. West’s appearance at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, when he interrupted an acceptance speech by Taylor Swift to complain that her award for best video by a female artist should have gone to Beyonce. And instead of adopting the apologetic stance he had previously taken when addressing the subject, Mr. West gave a more complicated and revealing response.

Funkmaster Flex began by inquiring if Mr. West had had any private conversations with Ms. Swift after the incident. He asked: “The first time that you actually got to speak to her without anybody around, what did that young lady say to you the first time she got to just speak to you - no cameras - what did she say? What were her words?”

Mr. West jokingly replied, “She said, ‘Ye, I just want to thank you so much.’ No, that’s not what she said.” After some laughter, Mr. West continued:

“She just talked about how people would come up to her in the grocery store and really just bring it up, and she would defend me at the grocery store - I’m sorry, defend me in an interview, she said at her grocery store, she was actually defending me. It’s an amazing, compelling situation. The situation is bigger to me than the Bush moment. It’s bigger than a lot of things. I try to downplay it, but for the sake of being able to try to sell records and just get acceptance on that level that I did as a pop artist, there’s just so few black men make it that far. That’s a responsibility, that’s why so many fans of mine were upset because they’re like: ‘Man, you’ve got a powerful situation where you can put your music out like that and do award shows and everything. You can’t be so reckless with your opinion. Like, we can agree with you but you’ve got to play it in another type of way, because you can’t throw away the opportunity.”’

Mr. West added: “Some of that power was taken away with that moment, and I think that’s what the bigger - to me, as a 33-year-old, someone that had to grow, as a celebrity, as soon as you become a star, as soon as it pops off for you, at that point, you stop growing. As soon as you don’t have to wash your own dishes any more.”

When Funkmaster Flex observed to Mr. West that “there’s something about it that you don’t always 100 percent agree with,” Mr. West replied:

“It’s not my show, but you’ve got to realize with Jordan - Jordan, Kobe, whoever - if you’re that important in the game, you can make that much of a difference. At a certain point, they’re going to say, we need instant replay clocks or we’re going to scream. Jordan used to be able to scream at the refs, because he’s Jordan. With us, when I see it happen, year after year after year - one of the things I really want to stress is it’s not a black or a white thing, even though it usually falls like that. It’s not. Because when Justin lost to the Dixie Chicks, it affected me, because I give so much of everything I am to music, and this is our only Super Bowl. This is something that matters, the documentation. If you look at the Grammys, the last four albums of the year were Taylor Swift, Herbie Hancock, Dixie Chicks, Ray Charles. It’s not a matter of any of that being black or white. It’s a matter of, all of that was incorrect. There’s two black people in there. Nonetheless, Ray Charles’s album was not the album of the year. I’m sorry.”

Funkmaster Flex observed that many awards shows give out their trophies as a way of making up to artists whose bodies of work they have previously overlooked, and Mr. West agreed.

“So many artists,” he said, “they didn’t appreciate it until after they pass away, and I think there’s where I get a lot of flak too, because I’m like, no, you’re going to appreciate this now. And not particularly me. You appreciate someone else. They’ve got to understand, that moment was very - they’re trying to say, oh, he’s arrogant. What was arrogant about that? That’s completely selfless. That’s like jumping in front of a bullet. I lost an arm. I’m walking around, I’m trying to put my album out with one arm right now. Every time I try to perform a song, everybody’s like, well, what’s up with that missing arm, though?”

When Funkmaster Flex said to Mr. West that he and Taylor Swift were “forever joined at the hip,” Mr. West replied:

“I made a mistake. My timing was definitely, extremely off and the bigger plan, the bigger fight - how do you go about it? How do you go about getting it done? And the thing is, it was all in the plan, like, Beyonce was set up to win the video of the year. If I hadn’t said anything, everything would have just went smoothly.”

Elsewhere in the interview, Mr. West repeated his charge that he was told by his “sales team” that Wal-Mart and Target would not accept his proposed artwork for the cover of his coming album, “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” and said the record would use a pixelated version of the cover illustration he had originally submitted. He also dodged Funkmaster Flex’s questions about whether or not he was dating the reality television personality Kim Kardashian.
