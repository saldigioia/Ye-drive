# London Bows Down Before Hip-Hop King

On a freezing London night, a queue stretched down Camden High Street and round the block: 1,500 fans waiting for hours to see the world’s most controversial rapper. At 7:30pm on Tuesday Kanye West announced a surprise London club gig. A queue had formed by 7:40pm. By the time the audience were admitted, after midnight, many seemed on the verge of hypothermia, and, I think it is fair to say, were in a volatile mood.

The throng jammed in front of the stage sang football terrace chants and belligerently demanded music.

When West finally came on at 1am, the tension in the room exploded into something entirely joyous. The American star delivered a stripped-back, hardcore hiphop set amid a rowdy posse of UK Grime rappers and Alist American guests, including Big Sean and the Wu Tang Clan’s Raekwon.

There was little evidence of the nuance and subtlety that has helped set West’s music apart, and he said nothing between songs. He just gave the people what they wanted, banging out hit after hit to body-shaking beats while jumping up and down and grinning manically.

The crowd went crazy. They held their hands in the air, filmed on mobile phones, recited lyrics in unison and sang out choruses. They were uproariously enthusiastic whenever homegrown heroes such as Skepta, Meridian Dan and JMC interspersed West’s set with local hits, including That’s Not Me and German Whip, while West prowled the stage behind, nodding to indicate his approval of (and, indeed, participation in) Britain’s own very distinctive hip-hop scene. And they practically self-combusted with glee as West ripped through simplified versions of Cold, So Appalled, New Slaves and more. Having debuted his single All Day only at the Brit Awards, it is already so firmly established in his canon that it was greeted like a greatest hit.

West didn’t attempt to sing any of his autotuned ballads, while his rich chords were barely perceptible in a mix that emphasised batteringram drums and sub-bass that could vibrate your inner organs. This was music of weird, futuristic electro intensity, with rhymes peppered over the top like blasts from a verbal shotgun. Where band leaders might guide musicians with eye contact and head gestures, West controls his set with throat-cutting gestures to two men on laptops in the wings.

For an outsider to the scene, it is impossible not to note aspects of ritualised banality, though perhaps you could say the same of most pop scenes. At times there were up to 10 men on stage, all dressed in black, whose only purpose seemed to be to look delighted to be there. There was no choreography, just a kind of bouncing and shambling, dipping up and down, waving salutes, and occasionally shouting into microphones in unison.

It was very masculine and occasionally very aggressive. It made me cringe to witness Big Sean’s puerile, sexist chant of “B———, I don’t f—-with you” being picked up enthusiastically by an audience of whom half were young women. It seemed out of place at a show headed by one of the most progressive artists of the genre.

None the less, this thrilling performance was a bravura celebration of the most vital pop form of our times. From a local perspective, it was about West demonstrating his affinity with London’s hip-hop community, and then showing how it can be done a little bit better.
