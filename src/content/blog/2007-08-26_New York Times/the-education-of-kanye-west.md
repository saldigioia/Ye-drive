# The Education of Kanye West

It was trademark Kanye West petulance. Late last year at the MTV Europe Music Awards, his clip for “Touch the Sky” lost the award for video of the year to “We Are Your Friends,” by the electronic musicians Justice vs. Simian. As So Me, the director of the winning video, was accepting the award, Mr. West, the multiplatinum rapper-producer, jumped onstage and interrupted him.

“Hell, no!” Mr. West shouted. He boasted that his video cost $1 million and ranted, “If I don’t win, your awards show loses credibility.”

Mr. West had long had a reputation as a venter, a performer whose public persona was refreshingly unchecked. When he proclaimed that “George Bush doesn’t care about black people” on a telethon after Hurricane Katrina, he helped galvanize the hip-hop world. This MTV outburst, though, came off like the gripes of a typical egotist. Suddenly he seemed like a blowhard, an ingrate. His outburst was posted on YouTube and widely mocked.

“A complete momentum killer” is how Mr. West sheepishly described the incident one recent evening as he relaxed at Chung King Studios in New York, where he was finishing his third album, “Graduation,” due Sept. 11 on Def Jam Records. Kicking off a pair of silver Yves Saint Laurent high-top sneakers, he compared himself to a giant stomping on “the people’s champ.” The day after the awards, he said, he holed up in his hotel room, chastened, ruminating over the bad press. “It was like I had killed somebody,” he said.

It was one in a series of regrettable events and choices that brought out the relentless self-questioner in him. Mr. West, 30, began to re-examine every aspect of his career, from his music to his image to his fashion sense. “Certain ways that I approached things, I could have done it with more tact and more class,” he said.

In part “Graduation” is the product of those efforts. It is his most eclectic album, drawing on a wide musical palette, including classic rock and dance music. And these musical shifts coincide with Mr. West’s developing his interests in other areas. He nods to hipster culture with an album cover designed by the Japanese pop artist Takashi Murakami and an alternate video for “Can’t Tell Me Nothing” starring the alternative comedian Zach Galifianakis, who filmed it at his North Carolina farm after he was personally solicited by Mr. West. Mr. Galifianakis lip-syncs to the song as he drives a tractor, accompanied by the indie-rocker Will Oldham and a troupe of clog dancers.

“He likes branching out and doing these odd things with his music,” said Mr. Galifianakis, who added that he tried to connect Mr. West and Mr. Oldham to discuss a potential collaboration. “It also expands his reach a bit.”

Mr. West is no longer just concerned with being popular; he also wants to be cool. But given the double-digit decline in rap sales this year and Mr. West’s status as one of few bankable hip-hop superstars, it’s a potentially risky time to be broadening, or diluting, his palette. Rap loyalists may blanch at his new directions, but Mr. West has never been solely beholden to rap fans or to rap modes of thought. While other hip-hop stars (50 Cent, Timbaland) have been flirting lately with pop collaborations to extend their brands, Mr. West has succeeded in large part by imposing his ornate style of hip-hop onto the mainstream.

And sometimes on rap fans as well. His current single, “Stronger,” which samples the innovative French D.J. duo Daft Punk, has been well received. “For hip-hop stations that actually play some progressive hip-hop, this is a good thing for the genre,” said Ebro Darden, program director of Hot 97, the New York FM radio station, of Mr. West’s sometimes unconventional reference points.

A native of Chicago, Mr. West emerged on the hip-hop scene six years ago as a traditionalist producer, resurrecting the dusty sounds of early 1990s New York-style rap and polishing them to a pop sheen. But while clearly steeped in hip-hop’s sonic traditions, he was an outsider to its lyrical ones, rapping on “The College Dropout,” his 2004 debut, about higher education, class struggle and his own self-doubts in ways particular to his middle-class upbringing. (His mother was a college professor, his father a photojournalist.) The result was a success with both hip-hop’s mainstream and its alternative (or “backpacker”) wing. (Mr. West wore a backpack, but it was by Louis Vuitton.) “Late Registration,” his follow-up from 2005, tackled similar subject matter and was more musically adventurous and ostentatious.

To date his most successful songs — “Jesus Walks,” “All Falls Down” and “Gold Digger” — have centered on larger ideas, but overall the tracks on “Graduation” are less conceptual, and less orchestrated, than his previous work. He samples Elton John and Mountain and includes a piano jam, “Homecoming,” featuring Coldplay’s Chris Martin, which recalls early Billy Joel. The album’s subject matter hops from casual boasting (“Barry Bonds”) to an ode to Jay-Z, Mr. West’s friend and mentor (“Big Brother”), to the self-explanatory (“Drunk and Hot Girls”). In parts, like the astral “Flashing Lights,” he is at his best, but unlike his previous albums “Graduation” doesn’t completely cohere.

As he listened to “Graduation” tracks at Chung King, Mr. West was so swaggering and loudmouthed that he seemed to absorb all of the energy in the room. But in between bouts of fist pumping he made earnest eye contact with the engineers and musicians and other people around him, clearly seeking approbation. “He understands what people can bring to him, and he’s not scared to reach for that,” said Alain (A-Trak) Macklovitch, Mr. West’s D.J.

Time and self-reflection seem to have sanded down some of his rougher edges. While he is still given to pronouncements about his greatness, he no longer appears to be waging war. Recently the rappers Beanie Sigel and 50 Cent taunted him publicly, but Mr. West didn’t snipe back.

Jay-Z, the rapper and president of Def Jam Records, Mr. West’s label, described some of his friend’s old behavior as “overcompensation.” Now Mr. West has realized “he doesn’t have to fight for that respect,” Jay-Z said. “He believes he has his just due. It’s growth.”

Mr. Darden said he thought Mr. West had become “smarter and more strategic in his movements,” and Mr. West does seem increasingly aware of the multiple audiences he would like to cultivate. To wit: the “Graduation” song with the most “blatant hit-recordness,” as Mr. West called it, is “Good Life,” a relaxed, airy, radio-friendly collaboration with this year’s cameo king, T-Pain. But in a nice twist, the video for that song was directed by Mr. West’s former nemesis, So Me. The two have even been spotted together at the trendy Los Angeles dance club Cinespace. If you can’t beat them, co-opt them.

Still, Mr. West doesn’t always get it right. “I mess up so much,” he said of his forays into fashion, art and the like. He pontificated at length about some of his missteps, particularly with style. (The lavender tuxedo he wore to the 2007 Grammys is a particular sore spot.) “For me to not be on the Vanity Fair best-dressed list, it’s good,” he said. “It’s motivation. Some people are gifted at specific things, but I had to develop a certain taste level. The thing I’m most talented at is the ability to learn.”

Mr. Macklovitch has witnessed that curiosity. “I’ve seen him, in Japan, go to the bookstore and spend hundreds of dollars to learn about art or architects,” he said. “There’s kind of a naïveté there sometimes, but this guy is trying to learn about the world.”

Mr. Murakami, the artist, echoed the sentiment. “His pursuit of uncompromised detail made me feel at times like there was another me besides myself,” he said via e-mail through a translator.

Not all of Mr. West’s new reference points are so studiedly cool, though. “I’ve got to make music like a little kid,” he said of his pop instincts. “That’s what made me successful to this point.” He seeks out new musical inspiration not on BET but on VH1. The mainstream rock bands the Fray and All-American Rejects are among his favorites. He heard the snare drum he used on “I Wonder,” a song from the new album, while shopping for furniture at Moss.

“I love TV on the Radio’s production,” he said, referencing the critically acclaimed Brooklyn indie-rockers, “but man, at the end of the day, Keane and the Killers have bigger hooks.” Mr. West stops, considers, then laughs. “The last thing I need now in my quest to be cool is for somebody to think I dissed TV on the Radio.”

In early August Mr. West went to MTV for an afternoon taping of “TRL,” which doubled as a news conference for this year’s MTV Video Music Awards. Mr. West was nominated in five categories, and the slate of nominees seemed almost tailored to his personal tastes, hip-hop stars like Timbaland, Rihanna and Akon on one side and ascendant hipster faves like Lily Allen and Peter, Bjorn and John on the other. (Mr. West will perform with Ms. Allen at the awards ceremony in early September, and he collaborated with Peter, Bjorn and John two weeks ago at a festival in Sweden.)

In the best video category, up against Mr. West’s “Stronger,” was a familiar name: Justice, nominated for the inventive clip for “D.A.N.C.E.” It looked like an obvious trap, and for a moment it seemed certain that Mr. West would fall right into it. “If anyone goes to YouTube and sees the video that I lost to, you’ll see that I was robbed,” he told the cameras, referring to last year’s upset.

But in the end he didn’t take the bait. “I would feel better to lose to this video right here, because this video is completely genius,” he said of “D.A.N.C.E.,” with what sounded like honest enthusiasm. “I think my video’s the best, but, you know, I could respect that.” It wasn’t quite humility, but it was a start.
