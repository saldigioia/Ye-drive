# Where the New Ye Meets the Old Kanye

## “Vultures 1,” the Rapper’s Album With Ty Dolla Sign, Arrived on the 20th Anniversary of His Debut, “The College Dropout.”

The old Kanye, the new Kanye. Kanye then, Kanye now. Few, if any, popular musicians have made as much hay from the tension between their prior selves and their current one. And no famous person perpetually sheds old fans and acquires new ones quite like Kanye West, now known as Ye.

He is forever testing loyalty, which is a polite way of saying that he often leans into odiousness, never more so than in the last 16 months, which have been peppered with bursts of antisemitic remarks and revelations about similar past behavior.

For a while, these latest provocations seemed to do what few of his past outbursts have done: remove him from the center of the conversation.

And yet, “Vultures 1,” his new album, opened at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart, and most of the past two weeks have been heavy with Ye news — about his earning a self-reported $19 million in a day from selling items from his clothing line for just $20, about the predictably chaotic release of the album, including ticketed listening sessions in arenas and pushback from artists who were sampled without approval.

Hundreds of thousands of fans, or millions, have boarded the train — in part because public opinion can be elastic, but also because even in this era of Ye, glimmers of an older Kanye remain.

It’s what makes listening to “Vultures 1” both uncanny and unnerving. Though it is not, strictly speaking, a Ye album — it’s credited to ¥$, the duo of Ye and the R&B singer Ty Dolla Sign — it is unmistakably tied to his musical legacy, an extension of old patterns that look slightly different in the rear view.

Lyrically, Ye only addresses his recent troubles in glances, no-stakes responses to a high-stakes game: “Keep a few Jews on the staff now,” he shrugs on “Stars.” On “Vultures,” he makes a crass sexual remark to assure that he can’t be antisemitic — the line, which was part of one of the early leaks from this album, became one of the most popular at his recent listening events.

Much of “Vultures 1” is like this — full of puerile punchlines that might feel freeingly childlike had they arrived at lower intensity moments. But in the context of Ye’s recent behaviors, they come off as almost distressingly glib.

Ye is almost exclusively rapping in the clipped, nonlinear style he’s largely used for the last decade — short bursts of words, verses that have very little narrative cohesion. It salts a track with his essence, with a minimum of emotional commitment. (“Beg Forgiveness,” on which he’s practically howling, is a notable exception.)

Where “Vultures 1” makes more sense is in its production, which is scabrous and tense, moodily emotive and urgent. The music says things the words don’t, or can’t.

It also indicates where Ye currently sees his legacy. Two of the dominant strains of contemporary hip-hop can be traced back to him: Drake and the melodic rap that emerged in his wake, which is in many ways indebted to “808s & Heartbreak” (2008); and the texture-focused darkwave rap perfected by Travis Scott and, more recently, Playboi Carti, which can be traced back to “Yeezus” (2013).

“Vultures 1” is an album that reads as a response to, and sometimes with, the artists in this second camp. It sounds current, which is to say it has mastered the electrifying gloom of arena-scale claustrophobia.

Ultimately, “Vultures 1” is a simulacrum of a strong Ye album — sometimes thinly constructed, but thickened with harsh sound and polished to a high shine. Some of West’s recent albums have been brittle inside and out, but this is music that, for better and worse, matches the moment, with songs that are pugnacious, brooding, lewd and a little exasperated.

Most revealingly, he is not going it alone. Broadly speaking, collaborators are re-embracing him (if, indeed, they ever chose otherwise). Guest verses are delivered by Freddie Gibbs, Quavo, Lil Durk, Playboi Carti and more. Producers include well-known long-timers like Timbaland, No I.D. and Mustard, alongside umpteen newcomers. ¥$ was announced as a headliner at Rolling Loud in Los Angeles, the annual hip-hop festival of record.

Though Ye offered a pro forma apology for his comments in December, he is far from craving a full rapprochement — when paparazzi found him at Los Angeles International Airport last Monday, he repeated his assertion that Black people couldn’t be antisemitic because they are Jews and said, “For all the kids that love me, all the Jewish kids that love me, I’m sorry if y’all had to hear a grown-up conversation with us screaming at each other.” His “Vultures 1” T-shirts directly reference the Norwegian black metal band Burzum, whose frontman Varg Vikernes is a convicted murderer known for white supremacist and antisemitic views.

By quirk of fate, it seems, “Vultures 1” was released on the 20th anniversary of “The College Dropout,” West’s major label debut album, and perhaps the most seismic hip-hop release of the 2000s.

Listening to “Dropout” after hearing “Vultures” is like being allowed out into the sunshine after enforced confinement in the basement. It is lush, curious and thick with historical reference. And it is often outlandishly funny — not simply a blueprint for a hip-hop less encoded with toughness, but also a blueprint for a rapper who understood himself as the author of the joke and also sometimes its target. When it is bitter, it is humorously so, and also woven through with the raw angst of someone who has yet to truly succeed.

At that time, West’s griping was refreshing, because hip-hop was still young enough that it hadn’t reached a phase of full self-interrogation. He cleared a path for self-doubt, for a kind of psychological modesty that hadn’t fully been explored yet.

But doing so took a profound level of musical skill as well as a profound level of ego. Ye’s humor has remained a constant throughout these two decades — even the rhythm of his punchline delivery on “Vultures 1” feels instantly familiar — and so has his sense of self.

Unlike his jokes, though, which still feel adolescent, it’s changed shape, curdling along the way. The righteousness of the overlooked is far different than the self-righteousness of the empowered.

Now, his work is marked by the inability to distinguish between a noble fight and a nuisance, and a tendency to mistake stubbornness for ethics. Kanye now, like Kanye then, seems to believe that all grievance is made equal, and that if a wall is erected in front of you, the only sensible response is to knock it down, rather than have any curiosity as to why it was built.
