# Unpredictable West Deserves Straight As

Kanye West is a pro when it comes to dropping out of college. He's done it twice — and even had the guts to leave the same English department headed up by his mom.

Lucky for her, and us, West is more adept at the music game. His beats were used in hits racked up by Jay-Z, Alicia Keys and Ludacris, but now West wants to get out of his dark studio and emerge as a rapper in his own right. I'm sure he would've done it sooner, but the Chicago native was temporarily sidelined with a broken jaw, which he suffered in a car accident in October 2002.

With College Dropout, West's career can only head in one direction. North. W-a-a-a-ay north. (That's up, for those who failed their orienteering classes.)

You might not be convinced by West's first track, We Don't Care, but once you get past his off-key singing and chorus of children, you'll realize the rest of Dropout deserves all As. His tracks are all over the place -- from the Daft Punk robo-thumps of The New Work Out Plan to the drum 'n' bass and Luther Vandross soul of Slow Jamz to the Aretha-on-helium sample behind School Spirit -- which makes College Dropout an unpredictable adventure.

Equally as important are West's rhyming skills, sly wit and choice of topics. He pokes fun at Madonna's American Life rap: "All the mocha lattes you gotta do Pilates." He also criticizes America's health-care system, recounts his mother's anti-racism efforts in the '50s and questions the validity of university degrees.

West, 26, isn't the most laid-back MC, but neither are the subjects of his songs. You can feel his passion as he raps about self-esteem (All Falls Down) and a crappy job at the Gap (Spaceship), but his pain is even more pronounced on Through The Fire, which he managed to record while his jaw was still wired shut.

"My dogs couldn't tell if I/ Looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky," West grimaces through his teeth. "It was televised/There's been an accident like Geico/They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael."

Through The Fire is a landmark song in hip-hop -- as is the video -- because it shows West at his most vulnerable. At a time when most rappers refuse to ruin their macho cred, West isn't afraid to let fans see his puffed-up cheeks and trips to the doctor.

Overall, though, his debut doesn't quite raise the bar as high as OutKast's award-winning Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, but Dropout is more innovative than most hip-hop veterans on the Roc-A-Fella label. Jay-Z included.
