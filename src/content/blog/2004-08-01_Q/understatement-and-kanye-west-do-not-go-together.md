## Understatement and Kanye West Do Not Go Together.

You somehow don't expect a rapper to order goat cheese salad and mineral water for his supper. But then Kanye West is anything but your average rapper. He arrives at the restaurant of Amsterdam's American Hotel nattily dressed in a lime green blazer, Pringle jumper and pressed jeans. He's shortish - around 5'7" - softly spoken and polite, even to two starstruck Dutch autograph hunters who catch him unawares with a mouthful of lettuce. 

In a few hours' time, West will play a sold-out show at Amsterdam's Paradiso, before his 20-strong party moves on to the VIP room at a nearby club. At the epicenter of the action is Roc-A-Fella CEO Damon Dash. On this whistle-stop promo tour, Dash has resolved to push Kanye West as hard as his Rocawear clothing or Armadale vodka brands.  

Right now, though, Victoria Beckham’s former confidante is high on mushrooms and giggling like a schoolgirl. A bevy of partially-clothed Dutch ladies hang on his every incomprehensible word.  

Earlier, he accidentally tipped a full bottle of vodka (Armadale, of course) on his head. Dash, like many a rowdy stag partygoer before him, has come to Amsterdam and blown his mind.  

There is one notable absence from the festivities. Kanye West is in his hotel room. It’s 2 AM and he’s still working: he has calls to make to the States regarding the $650,000 video for new single “Jesus Walks.” He has insisted on scrapping the clip and reshooting it at his own expense. “I just wasn’t happy with the concept,” explains West, who micromanages every minute detail of his blossoming career. This is a man with an empire to build.

A few days later, Kanye West is in London. Yesterday, while shopping on trendy Bond Street, he got snapped by the paparazzi for the first time. It was, he says, “a bit weird, a new experience.”  

His album, “The College Dropout,” released in February, has gone platinum in the UK, selling over 300,000 copies. To put this in context, Jay-Z — Roc-A-Fella's flagship act until his apparent retirement last year — shifted only 130,000 copies of his biggest-selling UK album, “The Black Album.”

Today, West is in Chelsea, watching Damon Dash pretend he lives in a beautiful rented townhouse for the sake of MTV’s “Cribs” program. Dash, ever hovering on that line between genius and buffoon, has shoehorned a guest appearance from West into the show, alongside plugs for Armadale vodka, Rocawear clothing, his newly launched magazine “America,” and various new Roc-A-Fella signings hanging around in the wings. 

One of these is pop singer Samantha Ronson, stepdaughter of Foreigner’s Mick Jones. Between takes, West muses on his newfound stardom. “Maybe I should have made my album less good so I’d have more room to grow,” he says. “I’m the hottest thing out. Am I not supposed to love myself?” Low self-esteem, it appears, is not a phrase in Kanye West’s dictionary. 

Not just the natural successor to Jay-Z’s crown, he made his name as a producer with a deft melodic touch and a keen ear for a sped-up soul sample. He was the man behind Twista's “Slow Jamz” and Jay-Z and Beyonce's “'03 Bonnie & Clyde.” Mariah Carey, Backstreet Boys, and Jennifer Lopez have all recently left their names and numbers after the beep.

As Dash shows MTV around his kitchen, the interviewer asks West if he can cook. “Um, I can cook cereal,” he mumbles.  

“Kanye knows how to cook beats,” says Dash, quick as a flash. A frown crosses West's brow. Later he berates his people for not preparing him enough. “I would have done my homework if I’d known I’d be talking,” he chides.

West's own crib in Los Angeles is not showy enough to be on MTV yet. But it will be soon, albeit with a cultured edge. “I’ve commissioned a painter to do his take on Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel. It will hang on the ceiling in my dining room,” he says proudly. “It's gonna have over 50 cherubs and saints.” 

When he's not being hip hop's Laurence Llewelyn Bowen, West keeps busy developing a clothing and trainers range called Mascott. He has also set up his own label, GOOD (Getting Out Our Dreams) Music, to which he’s signed his rapper pal Common. “I just wanna help out as many people as possible,” he says of his brand expansion plans. “I’m not trying to be king.”  

West’s superhuman drive and sense of his own destiny suggest otherwise. “Through The Wire,” the lead track on “The College Dropout,” was inspired by a horrific car crash he had in Los Angeles in 2002, just as his career was taking off. He broke his jaw in three places, was bedridden two weeks, and his shattered jaw was wired shut.  

Two weeks later, he insisted on recording the song, literally gritting his teeth: “Make music that’s fire,” he rapped. “Spit my soul through the wire.”  

“The metal plates will stay in for the rest of my life and it’ll hurt more as I get older,” West says, ticking the still pudgy right side of his jaw. “That’s wack, right?”  

Since the crash, he has been conscious to give crystal clear pronunciation to his rhymes and choose his words with care. “The accident meant that God was telling me to watch what I said,” he says.

Kanye West's life story stands in stark contrast to the tired cliché of getting into music to escape the deprivations of the ghetto. He was a happy child who wanted to study architecture and learned his way around computers and music programs by the age of five. “The naughtiest thing I did was getting caught with porno magazines in fourth grade,” he admits.   

Raised in Chicago, his mother, Donda, was an English professor at the city university; his father, Ray, a salesman and later a Christian marriage counselor. As a young man, Ray had been a Black Panther and instilled in his son an acute sense of racial injustice.  

“Sometimes he’d overdo it,” says West. “It’d always be, ‘They’re only saying that to me because I’m black.’”  

At 18, West enrolled in a Chicago art college but after two terms dropped out, to the dismay of his parents. He had decided his future lay in music. After three years of false starts, West was finally spotted by a Roc-A-Fella A&R rep and landed a plum role as Jay-Z's producer.  

Back then, Damon Dash discouraged his rapping ambitions. “Everybody had doubts,” West says. “The only person who ever believed 100 percent was me.”  

It can't be easy for West - whip smart and acutely aware of his potential for Eminem-style global domination - watching Dash constantly muscle his way into the spotlight. After all, he’s supposed to be the star.  

“What do you want me to say?” he says, the pitch of his voice rising in exasperation. “Do you think it’d be worth it for me to say anything?”  

I don't know, he's not my boss.  

“But he is mine. It’s one thing to be honest, but sometimes honesty is not always the best policy.”  

In any event, “The College Dropout” proved the doubters wrong, having shifted two million copies in the US to date. Perhaps uniquely in the rap genre, its themes are hugely candid about West’s middle-class past. “Spaceship” recalls his stint as a chinos folder at the Gap.  

He lets out his goofy smile. “I’m not a gangsta rapper - I’m just a regular man.” He pauses, as if his rapper auto-ego switch has just clicked on. “A man who likes pussy, though.”
