# Spaced-Out West Flies the Frenzied Skies

Even as concertgoers exited the United Center Friday, Kanye West still wasn’t through with them. Ushers handed out a booklet of self-help West-isms, just in case the fans didn’t get enough Kanye in the first 90 minutes.

That would’ve been hard to fathom.

The “Glow in the Dark” tour was all Kanye all the time: a man onstage, alone with his fabricated spaceship and the disembodied voice of “Jane,” his co-pilot. His band played in the shadows of the sub-stage orchestra pit, while West (who played a second United Center show Saturday) embarked on a lost-in-space journey that suggested a one-man play as much as it did a concert. It retooled songs from West’s three multimillion-selling albums, which trace a young man’s path to adulthood, and turned them into dramatic opportunities.

West rapped, sang and danced up a sweat-soaked frenzy, veins popping from his neck, arms flailing. He even did a few push-ups. The songwriter/producer portrayed himself as hip-hop’s answer to Jean-Paul Sartre: an existentialist whose narrative was abetted by cosmic video and smoke machines, and salted with references to Samuel Beckett, Stanley Kubrick’s “2001: A Space Odyssey” and David Bowie’s “Space Oddity.”

It certainly was like no hip-hop show ever staged. Instead of roaming posses of guest MCs and hangers-on and wave-your-hands-in-the-air audience-participation gambits, West opted for stylized solo theatricality and an almost eerie intensity. He never cracked a smile, but there was no questioning his commitment to the material. His voice was by turns defiant (“Can’t Tell Me Nothin’”), resilient (“Through the Wire”), prayerful (“Jesus Walks”), consumed by unrequited lust (“Gold Digger”) and celebratory (“Touch the Sky”).

In space, boys really miss their moms and West was no exception. “Hey Mama,” in tribute to educator Donda West, who died last year, was re-energized with fresh verses, and was unquestionably the emotional centerpiece of the concert. But the rapper didn’t take any moment for granted, as demonstrated by the agile dance steps that topped off “Flashing Lights” or the defiant screams that punctuated “Stronger.”

The only letdown was the tepid “Homecoming” as the first encore, an anticlimax after the emotional potency of “Jesus Walks,” “Hey Mama” and “Stronger.” Otherwise, this was first-tier arena-rap. If West’s self-help booklet was more evidence of an ego run amok, the concert was egomania reconfigured as a flawed but fascinating psychodrama.

West’s opening acts also brought not just music, but personality — an essential ingredient when serenading a sold-out basketball stadium.

Rihanna didn’t play R&B diva so much as new-wave siren; in thigh-high boots and red vinyl jacket, she could’ve passed for Prince. Her hits, “SOS” and “Don’t Stop the Music” in particular, dished sleek electro-groove thrills.

Lupe Fiasco’s cerebral, rapid-fire rhymes dovetailed with engaging singalong hooks proffered by vocalists Nikki Jean, Sarah Green and Matthew Santos. N.E.R.D. placed mega-producers Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo in a world rife with heavy-metal riffs and dueling drum solos, and turned it into a rap-rock celebration, with a bevy of dancers from the audience joining the band.

One disappointment: With Fiasco, Williams and West in the house, a reprise of their brilliant 2007 Internet collaboration “Us Placers” seemed tailor-made. No such luck. It wasn’t a night for collaborations, but solo flights.
