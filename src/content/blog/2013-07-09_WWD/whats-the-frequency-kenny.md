# What’s the Frequency, Kenny?

Kanye West is giving James Franco a run for his money in the surprising collaborations department.

The music star has teamed with French contemporary brand A.P.C. on a capsule men’s collection consisting of a pair of jeans, a hoodie and a T-shirt. They are to go on sale at A.P.C. stores worldwide on Sunday, which is Bastille Day in France, as well as online.

The partners revealed the project simultaneously on Monday via Twitter, posting a close-up of the joint red label sewn into the waistband of stonewashed jeans.

A.P.C. founder Jean Touitou said West first visited his studio two years ago seeking his advice on the fashion industry, and was announced to him as “Kenny.” Touitou confessed he didn’t know he was talking to the music deity until he lowered his sunglasses and said, “I’m a hip-hop artist.”
