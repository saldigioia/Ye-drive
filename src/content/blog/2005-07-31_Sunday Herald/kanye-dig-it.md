# Kanye Dig It?

## Rap and Religion Do Not Usually Go Together — Unless You Are Hip-Hop Star Kanye West.

Kanye West is not happy. For the past 10 minutes the hip-hop star has been arguing with his girlfriend on the phone. And she is threatening to break up with him if he dares end the conversation.

On and on, goes the argument. West accuses her of some misdemeanor with rap kingpin Jay-Z, then they are revisiting a past conversation. All the while, West is trying to tell his girlfriend he cannot talk because he is in an interview.

Growing more agitated, he says: “I’m at work. You know I can’t talk now. I’ve got stuff to do.”

Finally, after more exasperated exchanges, they agree to talk later. The mobile phone is folded up and West is ready to start talking about his new album Late Registration.

Due on August 8, Late Registration is the follow-up to West’s hit album from last year, The College Dropout. It sold three million copies, was nominated for 10 Grammy Awards, helped land West a place in Time Magazine’s 100 Most Influential People and turned him into one of the hottest names in hip-hop.

West admits he was nervous when he entered the studio to record his second solo album.

“The pressure was on,” he says.

“The heat is on. But that’s the joy of being under pressure, to go back and win that second championship.

“The ability to create and be creative is the reason why I think I can overcome the sophomore slump.”

Australia will get its first taste of West’s new album when his track Diamonds from Sierra Leone is released this week.

In an earlier interview, West told reporters the album’s aim was to tell the world about the civil wars in Sierra Leone, fuelled by the diamond trade.

The religious West said God told him to write the track: “I’m, like a ghetto Pope, God is the executive producer of my life, and I’m the closest hip-hop has to God”.

Later, in our exclusive interview, he elaborates: “Diamonds from Sierra Leone is not something I set out to do,” he says.

“It’s something that He wanted me to tell people about.

“He sent the right people, the right angels to deliver the message and now the message is delivered on an international scale.

“It’s about spreading knowledge.”

West’s religious faith, first seen on his debut album with Jesus Walks, makes him an anomaly in the tough world of gangsta rap. In this world, drugs and guns get more than a passing reference and a bullet-proof-vest-wearing rapper called 50 Cent is the big dog on the block.

But as he munches on a stick of carrot and sips some water, West, who sports a wool jumper with no bullet proof vest in sight, says he and 50 Cent are just two sides of the hip-hop movement.

“50 is like this king from another land and I am like respectful,” he says.

“50 is one of my favourites.”

West also says they both have a history of “overcoming a near fatal, tragic situation”.

For 50 Cent, his brush with death was in May 2000 when he was shot nine times.

West’s near-death experience was an October 2002 car crash as he drove away from an LA recording studio. The accident left his jaw shattered in three places. His wired face provided the inspiration for his first hit single, Through the Wire.

“There are so many things that are similar, but his (50 Cent’s) niche is he provides this type of music and I provide that type of music,” West says.

“But a lot of things are similar, the hustler mentality, the leader mentality of leading a span of people, wanting to make music that touches the world in a certain way.

“We’re so similar, though; we’re the Yin and the Yang.”

The two may be set to continue their parallel lives into the movie world. 50 Cent recently finished a film on his life called Bulletproof. West wants to be as big as Hollywood director and producer Steven Spielberg.

“I feel more of a role in entertaining,” West says.

“I felt like I was the rap Ben Stiller or the rap Dave Chappelle at one point, but now with this new album I am saying I am more the rap Steven Spielberg.”

West says that just as Spielberg made his popcorn movies, such as ET, and conscience films, such as Schindler’s List, he too has different styles in his music.

“He expresses all these different things and that’s kind of what I do,” he says, giving as an example two songs from his first album College Dropout.

West says his Schindler’s List equivalent was Jesus Walks, a conscience rap. His ET was the bump-and-grind track on the same album, Slow Jamz.

“I’m in a rap position of a Spielberg when I do Jesus Walks — it’s a Schindler’s List,” he says. “It’s so impactful because I gave you ET, I gave you Slow Jamz.”

But his ambitions go beyond music and films, revealing he may also be involved in a cure for AIDS and cancer.

“The sky’s the limit,” he says.

“I am not talented for anything except the ability to learn.

“And if I am really convinced by something, if it’s something that really means a lot to me, then not only will I be able to learn how to do it to the point where I can be successful at it — but I will do it to the point where it pushes whatever that is, ahead of where it was before I got into it.”

It’s about now that I ask Kanye if his self-belief is sometimes misinterpreted as, perhaps, arrogance.

West dismisses the notion.

“How do you tell a car that has an endless gas supply that he’s not going to drive across the country,” he says.

“I know that I have endless gas. My mother told me don’t think you will go broke one day, of course plan for the worst, but expect the best.

“So many people don’t expect the best.”

Clearly Kanye West expects the best.
