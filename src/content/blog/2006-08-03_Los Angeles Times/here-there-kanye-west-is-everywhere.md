# Here, There, Kanye West Is Everywhere

If they mount a music festival in 2006 and Kanye West doesn’t show up, is it still a festival? After his triumphant appearance at Coachella this past April, the loquacious talent has been as popular at festivals as misting fans.

To wit, thus far in 2006, he’s touched the sky at Roskilde (Denmark), Quart (Norway), the Cool Jazz Fest (Lisbon), the Stockholm Jazz Fest, the Heineken Open’er (Gdynia, Poland) and the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans. Still to come: Bumbershoot in Seattle and double duty this weekend, performing at Lollapalooza in Chicago and San Diego’s Street Scene, where he’ll join Tool, Snoop Dogg and Social Distortion, among others.

Rob Hagey, who’s been putting together Street Scene since 1984, doesn’t seem concerned that West’s ubiquitous presence at festivals might lessen his stature. “He crosses over so many genres.... To have that kind of a presence and that kind of an act, we’re thrilled.” As West’s schedule of festival appearances is run down, Hagey says: “That’s just brilliant, good management, good booking.” The mastermind behind that plan is CAA’s Jeff Frasco, West’s booking agent.

“This was the plan with Kanye. He’s got a very wide audience so this just kind of solidifies and adds a lot of credibility to everything,” Frasco says. Next for West is a slot opening for U2 in Australia. Is there anyone else who could have pulled this run? “Kanye is very unique,” Frasco says. “At this time he’s perfectly suited to cross over like this.”
