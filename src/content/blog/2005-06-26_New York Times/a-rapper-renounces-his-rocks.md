# A Rapper Renounces His Rocks

## This Year Kanye West Has Given Listeners a Chance to Witness His Political Evolution Over the Course of a Single Song.

This year Kanye West has given listeners a chance to witness his political evolution over the course of a single song. First came "Diamonds Are Forever," the first single from Mr. West's hotly anticipated new album, "Late Registration." He is hip-hop's leading rapper-producer, beloved for his wistful beat-making and shameless punchlines; here, over an addictive Shirley Bassey sample, he rhymed, "Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name/It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say Kayne."

Then came the astonishing video: moved by reports of the suffering associated with the diamond trade in Africa, Mr. West teamed with Hype Williams to film a surreal black-and-white clip for the track, now called "Diamonds From Sierra Leone." Filmed in Prague, it unfolds like a De Beers commercial run amok: a diamond ring draws blood from a delicate finger; young (ostensibly African) children with black contact lenses materialize in the streets; text urges viewers not to buy "conflict diamonds." And yet the lyrics stay the same: racing through the streets of Prague, Mr. West is still cracking jokes about his own unlikely career.

On the remix, featuring Jay-Z, Mr. West delivers the back story:

> I thought my Jesus-piece was so harmless

> 

> Till I seen a picture of a shorty, armless

> 

> And here's the conflict

> 

> It's in a black person's soul to rock that gold

> 

> Spend your whole life trying to get that ice

> 

> On a Polo rugby, it look so nice

> 

> How could something so wrong make me feel so right?
