# The Media Assassin

## To the Passive Observer, Kanye West Is Hip Hop's Critical Darling, but Kanye's Quite Sure That He Should Be Number One on Everybody's List. Does It Make You Wish He No Longer Exist?

Kanye West is a frustrating genius. Not frustrated — he’s actually quite prolific, and he certainly has the Midas touch (just ask his man Common) — but frustrating. He’s a friendly enough guy, but the 28 year-old rappin’ producer is just one of the most contrary people you’ll ever meet. Pick a topic and he’s ready to argue. Ask him if he loved De La Soul growing up and he’ll tell you he preferred Kid ’N Play and Hammer. Ask him about his sampling technique and he’ll tell you he’d rather talk about his sneaker game or porn. But, *The College Dropout* [Roc-A-Fella/Def Jam, ’04] was that hot-fire, and so is his new album *Late Registration* [Roc-A-Fella/Def Jam, ’05], so we at *Mass Appeal* love K. West in spite of himself, and you should too. Now take off your shoes, let the dogs bark and read as your favorite magazine engages in mental chess with Kanyeeze. The problem is, we’re not quite sure who checked who.

**When do you feel like the media has attacked you?**

What they do is, they take my words and they’ll flip it. I’ll say I feel like we should get paid to be on magazine covers, meaning we, as the wrist, on olative evil uness he get pay Make said “me” thing, making it like I’m this pompous bastard when really, I was standing up for the rights of artists. Then they turn around and say, “What magazines will actually pay Kanye?” just to try to bug me. Then they flipped it and said I was supposed to be posing for Playgirl because Playgirl said they would pay me but l’ve never actually spoken to Playgirl or anything like that. So it all came from that statement that was about artist empowerment, but they didn’t like that. They didn’t like where that was going and they almost put the battery in my back, but l’m too busy making good music and when I have less on my plate, I will make sure artists get paid to be on covers. Within the next maybe ten years down the line.

**Why do you think artists should be paid to be on covers?**

The same reason why artists get paid for their songs getting played on the radio. Everybody gets paid except for one of the main people selling the magazine.

**It’s different because on radio they’re playing your composition, on a magazine cover they are providing promotional service. Like if you printed a million…**

But the radio is promotion too.

**But if you went to a flyer shop and printed a million flyers with your face on them and had them distributed nationally, you’d have to pay for that.**

Well, people tour in order to sell records but they also get paid at they concert.

**Yes, but you’re providing performance. Are you performing now?**

Yes I am.

**How so?**

I’m giving you some of my time.

**Mass Appeal appreciates that.**

Yeah, I’m giving you a piece of my time when I should be working on my album making sure that I give the fans what they are waiting for.

**But don’t you think that doing interviews gives the fans something that they’re waiting for as well?**

Yes and no. If I wouldn’t have done any interviews and I let my music speak for itself, maybe I would have been better off.

**That definitely could be true. Don’t you think that at this point, with people being able to download music for free, that part of what you re selling is the personality and therefore doing interviews allows you to communicate your personality so that fans get connected to you?**

Yeah, that’s true. Really, I like doing interviews. I like getting my opinion out there. I like saying stuff that I couldn’t have put into a rhyme. That’s what “Last Call” was. That was what I would have said if I had time to actually write that in a verse, but I didn’t have time so I just spoke it out because the album needed to be turned in. But I do think that if magazines are paid money for ads, the artist on the cover is part of the selling point. Magazines always talk about, “Oh, well I had this person on the cover and he wasn’t interesting so that cover did terrible even though he sold this amount of records. Then we got this person, this person is interesting and it did well.” So, I think for all the wild stuff that I said, that was somewhat interesting.

**That’s true, but on the flipside, your covers last year were the second to lowest selling of both of the major rap magazines you appeared on.**

Well, *XXL* wasn’t just my cover.

**True — Dave Chappelle, Talib Kweli, Common and dead prez were with you.**

Yeah, so don’t try to put it on me.

**I’m not. Looking back on this last year, what do you feel like, if anything, you mishandled?**

I wouldn’t have changed anything because I expressed who I was at that time. I got my frustrations out and maybe I lost fans that I’ll never be able to get back. Maybe people look at me in a certain light but a lot of things where people were doubting me, feeling like I couldn’t do something, undermining me, placing me in a different category than what I felt. It’s just like if you were at a bar and somebody threw a drink on your girl and you didn’t do anything, you would kill yourself for the rest of your life. Now mind you, if you got into a bar fight, you might end up locked up that night but you would feel better that at least you said something, at least you did something about it. You didn’t just sit there and just let people just shit on you like that.

**Do you feel like you been shitted on? You’re hugely successful.**

I feel like I gave a lot with *The College Dropout* and a lot of people were scared to give it what it deserved. When you do stuff like blatantly put “Never Let Me Down” on an album, knowing that you’ll never get to it as a single, that’s for the fans. That’s really like I want to make good music, it’s not a business move at all. Every move I make is not — like I really do this stuff purely to put good energy out there, good messages, good entertainment. I’m here at your disposal. I’ve sacrificed my life, my anonymity. Sometimes I wish I could just…

**Wasn’t “Never Let Me Down” an outtake on The Blueprint 2? But that’s besides the point. I feel like you’ve been very conscious about your desire to be famous. When *Mass Appeal* interviewed you in 2002 you were talking about being pissed off because you came to the studio wearing some crazy sneakers and then Jay-Z or whoever would see them then you’d see them in the video rocking the kicks then hear people talking about them. You said you wanted to be famous to keep that from happening.**

Well, I’ll say I wanted to get the credit. All I want is my name on the John Legend video by itself. But on the same token it’s kind of like a person that gives up everything that they have and at the end of the day all they want is for you to recognize that this is the person that gave that. I want to give my art to people at the sacrifice of my financial, to give up art. It’s the same token as spending your last money to go to the studio when you’re unsigned, but it’s just on a bigger scale.

**How do you feel misunderstood?**

Because I’m really a nice guy. Where I go off the deep end is when people are in positions where they don’t live up to their position. It could be as small as someone is supposed to clean up something and their job is to be a janitor but the floor is dirty all the way up to your job being a president at a label and the promotion is not set up right. My grandfather said whatever you do, whether you’re a janitor, make sure those are the cleanest floors possible. Whatever it is you say you do. Like if you are a writer and you want to make sure you put out the right information.

**But when I wrote my last article about you, even though everyone said how good it was, you still got mad and called to complain…**

What are you doing right now? Are you defending yourself?

**Yeah.**

No! You’re not allowed to do that! You’re doing a Kanye West right now! You’re not allowed to defend yourself!

**Why not?**

‘Cause people will look at you like, ‘Hey, man, what makes you think yours is so good? Why you telling me that that’s the best article?’

**Because it is.**

I don’t want to hear that from you though. That’s just not the American way. And right now, you just being Kanye West. That’s exactly what I did. I defended my album and everyone said I wasn’t allowed to do that. Sometimes, you know… My main message, what I wanted to give, and I was gonna actually touch on that in my Grammy speech. The greatest thing about winning a Grammy is the plateau to speak to so many people. That’s the reason why I rapped in the first place. I felt like I had something to say to people. I want to tell people to just, like what John Mayer was saying.— just put yourself in my shoes for a second — well, not put yourself in my shoes — but just act like me for a second.
