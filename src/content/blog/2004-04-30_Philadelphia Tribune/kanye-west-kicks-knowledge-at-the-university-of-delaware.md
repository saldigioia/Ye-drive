# Kanye West Kicks Knowledge at the University of Delaware

At age 26, Kanye West is already considered one of the most talented producers in music. The Chicago-based producer and songwriter has created hits such as Jay-Z’s “Izzo (H.O.V.A.),” Beanie Sigel’s “The Truth,” Alicia Keys’ “You Don’t Know my Name,” and Ludacris’ “Stand Up.”

West is now adding another career to his resume, as a solo rap artist with his debut album, “The College Drop Out.” The album is currently the No. 14 album in the country and No. 5 on the R&B/Hip Hop Billboard magazine charts.

West recently brought his “The College Drop Out Tour” to the University of Delaware where he performed for more than 4,000 students.

The show opened with Philadelphia-based Roc-A-Fella Record rappers the Young Gunz. The Young Gunz, comprised of Chris and Neef, performed their hit songs “No Better Love” and “Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop.”

Kanye West performed next with a keyboardist, bass player and disc jockey. West began the hour-long performance with a medley of some of the hit songs he wrote and produced. Then he featured his hit songs from his debut album including “When It All Falls Down,” “Jesus Walks,” and “Through the Wire.”

In between selections, West spoke to students about the importance of staying in school and making your own decisions.

West began his career coproducing songs for Bad Boy recording artist Mase. After achieving some professional success in the music industry, he dropped out of art school in Chicago after one year. His college experience would later be used as an inspiration for his debut album, “The College Dropout.”

West caught his big break when his work attracted the attention of Jay-Z’s Roc-A-Fella Records. West produced and wrote hit songs with classic R&B samples configured with today’s hottest drum beats. West was fully highlighted on Jay Z’s 2001 classic, “The Blueprint.”

West’s near fatal Los Angles car accident in October of 2002 became an inspiration for creating a new voice in rap music. While driving back to his hotel late one night after a Los Angeles recording session, West was involved in a car accident in which he sustained injuries that left his jaw fractured in three places. News reports of the accident surprised the rap music industry. Just weeks after the accident, and with his jaw still wired shut, he recorded “Through the Wire,” a personal account of the events that resonates with uncanny wit and raw emotion.

“I have flashbacks of what happened every day,” Kanye said. “And anytime I hear about any accident, my heart sinks in and I just thank God that I’m still here. That steering wheel could have been two inches further out, and that would have been it. You find out how short life is and how blessed you are to be here.”

On his debut album, West not only produces, writes and performs his own music and lyrics, but presents himself as a thoroughly well-rounded artist with a purpose and musical vision all his own.

The album features many hits songs, including “When It All Falls Down,” based around a “Lauryn Hill Unplugged” vocal loop that addresses materialism in the Black community; “Two Words” featuring Mos Def, Freeway, and the Harlem Boys Choir; and “Slow Jamz,” which features actor/comedian/singer Jamie Foxx and rapper Twista.

West wants to establish himself as a true renaissance artist who can write, produce, arrange and perform. “In hip-hop people always have preconceived ideas about you when you’re a producer who also rhymes,” said West. “But one of the main things I want to stress is that Stevie Wonder produced his own music. Prince produced his own music. Tyrone Davis and Bobby Womack - all these different people. And you don’t even think about the fact that they created their own songs. So I don’t see what I do as being any different.

“The best thing about the fact that I did beats is I can make the perfect plateaus for me to present information over. I make music that’ll catch people’s ear automatically.”
