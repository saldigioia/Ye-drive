# Work It!

Kanye West may have a rep for being a no-show at some of his recent gigs, but the rapper certainly doesn’t want to miss a single runway show. With his fledgling designer fiancé Alexis Phifer in tow, West crossed the Atlantic and popped up in the front rows of no fewer than 10 shows during the Paris collections. Like a fashion editor on speed, West rallied for Lanvin, John Galliano, Chanel, Stella McCartney, Yves Saint Laurent, Givenchy and Vivienne Westwood, to name but a few. And, of course, the rapper couldn’t forgo Louis Vuitton, a brand to which he gives a prominent shout-out in his hit single, “Stronger.” And just what does the Louis Vuitton Don Kan like? We’re sure it has nothing to do with those scantily clad models.
