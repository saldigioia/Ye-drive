# Kanye Goes on Late. Really Late.

Somebody’s got beef. Waiting until 4:30 a.m. to start his set, originally scheduled for 2:45, did not endear Kanye West to his audience or to fellow musicians. Robert Randolph, the gospel slide guitarist, came dangerously close to cussing as he complained about Mr. West, and since he was in the middle of a fierce, bluesy, one-chord raveup, with T-Bone Burnett playing blues licks like snakebites, his putdown arrived with extra force. After his set, the crowd chanted “Kanye sucks!”
