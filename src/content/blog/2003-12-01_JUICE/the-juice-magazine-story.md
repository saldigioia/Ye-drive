# The JUICE Magazine Story

## He Has the Beats That Every Rapper Is Currently Craving. And Recently, Alongside Such Diverse Guys as Jay-Z, Ludacris, or Common, Millionaire Ladies Like Alicia Keys, Britney Spears, and Janet Jackson Are Also Lining Up for His Soul-Infused Productions. For Kanye West Himself, Such Commissions Play Only a Subordinate Role. The 26-Year-Old From Chicago Is Diligently Working on His Second Career as an MC. On January 27th, His Long-Awaited Album Will Finally Be Released, Equally Anticipated by Hardcore Club-Goers and Disheveled Backpackers.

***Disclaimer:** This article was originally published in print in the fall of 2003 by JUICE magazine. It was re-published digitally as part of the "20 Years of JUICE – An Anniversary Worthy of Celebration" series. At the time of its original publication, Kanye West was primarily known as a leading producer, particularly for his work with Jay-Z. The interview, conducted by Adrian Schrader, is one of Kanye West's earliest print interviews and possibly his first with a European outlet. The article has been translated from its original German text for inclusion in this anthology.*

Kanye West greets the journalist from Europe only very briefly. He also hardly takes note of his numerous homies who have already been waiting for hours. He immediately sits down on a chair in the back part of the small studio, sways his head back and forth as if in a trance, and mumbles incomprehensible sentences to himself. His gaze is fixedly directed at the floor. This state lasts for about a quarter of an hour. Hardly any talking takes place during this time. Then Kanye suddenly stands up, takes off his jacket, and goes straight into the recording room. He puts on the headphones, falls into a trance again for a few seconds, and then—while directing the sound engineer to the desired spot at lightning speed—throws two verses and a chorus into the microphone. A few minutes and some brief outbursts of anger later, the recording is in the can, and a much more relaxed Kanye West, now in the mood for joking, is back among his managers, friends, audience, and questioners. That was truly an impressive introduction to Roc-A-Fella's work ethic.

"Aha, Just Blaze has found another imitator," probably not only thought the person reporting here when Kanye's first beats made the rounds. Upon closer listening, or at least with the release of "Dead Or Alive" on Cam'ron's last album, it became clear that Kanye West masters the game of speeding up samples, but does not intend to limit himself to soul classics when sourcing them. There has always been more finesse involved than with the other in-house producers at Roc-A-Fella. The Chicago shooting star, who is just about to produce the next album by Common, thereby closing the circle that began with albums produced by Kanye's mentor No I.D. like "Can I Borrow A Dollar" and "Resurrection," now stands for an incredible range of production styles. Of course, he likes to sample the Jackson Five with the help of Def Jam's coffers, pitches Chaka Khan to his liking, likes to add claps to the snare hit, and also loves to build rich drum breaks and bouncy kicks into his beats. But what is really common to his beats is just one thing: the character. It is an attempt to make music that remains interesting much longer than until leaving the dance floor. Music that, like all really good products in the field of rap music, makes you want to get to know those styles that underlie it. But also music that will soon serve only one rapper as a foundation for his stories: himself.

Kanye West is an extraordinarily good rapper for a producer. But who cares. He still lacks a good portion of consistency, solidity, and statics in the construction of his rhymes. But even if his raps are still slightly improvable compared to the elite, a lot is expected from this hard-working talent at sample and microphone. Kanye West has undergone rapid development, and it is very likely that he will also have an equally rapid one ahead of him. We are not leaving his side.

I am still quite confused by what I have just experienced. Do you never write your lyrics down on paper? Do your pieces always originate completely in your head?

Yes, I haven't written anything down for six years. I haven't had a pen in my hand since I dropped out of college.

Are you still concerned about the fact that you dropped out of school? After all, you have already announced that your albums will bear titles like "College Dropout," "Late Registration," and "Graduation"—all terms from school life.

No, that has never bothered me much. But when I was still going to school, I was already quite pissed off.

**What annoyed you so much?**

It bothered me that I couldn't just do what I felt like doing. Watching porn all day or something. But I also learned a lot in school. For example, I took singing lessons. You wouldn't have thought that, would you?

"Hell yeah, man! I'm going to bring them a lot of money through my raps."

**Did you take lessons in classical singing?**

No, no, we sang about as badly as I did earlier. We sang songs like (singing) "You could be as good as the rest of them, or as bad as the worst, but don't test me." At the end of the school year, we had to sing the song at the graduation ceremony. When the principal said, "And now the first graders would like to sing a song for you!" we started singing loudly, "Grab your guns when you see Tupac!" (he laughs heartily)

**When did you start making beats?**

I've been making beats since I was in 7th grade. Back then, I didn't know a single other producer. I started selling beats at 14. The starting price was $50.

**And how did you make the beats?**

I had a small computer, with a graphics and a music program. Back then, I had no idea what sampling was. I just played around with this thing all the time. Initially, I mainly made house beats.

**Have you ever released anything in that direction?**

No! It all sounded pretty bad. But that's exactly what I tried to explain to people when I fought to get a record deal: "You may not like my rap style, but watch out! In a few years, I'll be rapping really well." I'm focused. My beats used to be trash too. And now everyone is screaming for them. But they just said back then: "Yeah, yeah, go ahead and tell."

**So how did you still manage to get a record deal with Roc-A-Fella? Through Beanie Sigel, or?**

Yes, to some extent. No, actually through my manager HipHop [Kyambo Joshua, the A&R of Roc-A-Fella], who is one of Jay-Z's best friends. His job is to look for various beats. He heard my beats, and apparently, he felt that they had something special that could change the face of music. And that's how it was and is. Was that too thickly applied? (to his manager; she replies with a reassuring shake of the head) HipHop heard the beat for "The Truth" on one of my beat CDs and picked it out. The night we recorded the track, I played him a few other things. Among other things, several tracks on which I rapped. Afterward, he wanted to manage me but didn't know how to win me over for this deal. I think that's why he asked his old friend No I.D. [the man who brought us, among other things, "Resurrection" by Common], who taught me how to make beats. He told him to just tell me that he liked my raps. So he finally told me that he wanted to sign me as a producer and rapper. I agreed immediately because my management back then did not want to market me as a rapper.

**Is your current management really happy about your rap career?**

Hell yeah, man! I'm going to bring them a lot of money through my raps.

**I'm just saying because the release of your album has been postponed countless times...**

Ah, you mean that. That was entirely my decision. This way, demand increases. I currently have so much publicity; I'm often on TV; I rap on the first single by Twista, on the first single by the Dilated Peoples, and so on. This increases people's expectations more and more.

**What sets the collaboration with Jay-Z or other Roc-A-Fella artists apart from...**

Jay-Z writes his raps damn fast, and you know that tracks with him automatically become hits. So it's the easiest job in the world to work for him. Unfortunately, this job will be over after the next album. So it will be hard again.

**I actually wanted the sentence to go on longer. I wanted to ask you about the differences between working with other Roc-A-Fella artists and those with independent artists like Talib Kweli, Mos Def, or the Dilated Peoples. After all, someone like Jay-Z would be less likely to do something like that...**

Jay-Z? But sure! Why shouldn't he? As far as I know, he rapped his part on the "Get By" remix by Talib Kweli for free.

**Okay, but that was more the exception, right?**

Hmm, I think many of the barriers between HipHop and Gangster Rap no longer exist. Now it's about good music. People have a lot of prejudices against Jay-Z. He's rich and can do whatever he wants.

**There was just a violinist here who played a sequence for one of your tracks. When did you start using this option?**

Only when I had more money at my disposal. Such a thing costs a damn lot. I only started building good relationships with some musicians.

**And how will that be on your album?**

I used real strings for about 80% of the tracks. In addition, there are numerous choir voices, bass lines, guitars, and also live-played percussion elements on the album.

**In "Through The Wire," the first single that has already been released, you tell the story of an accident that almost cost you your life. What exactly happened?**

Last October, just before Halloween, I had a car accident and broke my jaw in three different places. I recorded the track two weeks later when my jaw was still fixed with countless wires. That's why the track is called "Through The Wire." The song was basically my escape from the valley of tears. I tried to laugh at everything. I drop rhymes like "My dawgs couldn't tell if I, I look like Tom Cruise in 'Vanilla Sky.'"

**And how are you now?**

I'm still pretty messed up, but I still managed to become "Honey Of The Month" in "Honey Magazine." Imagine what would happen if my jaw were properly aligned...

**Is it true that you had to pay for the video clip for "Through The Wire" yourself?**

Yes, that's true. My label thought the track was just meant for a mixtape. They thought the whole text was a freestyle, even though I say at the beginning, "I'm giving an account of how I almost died." They probably thought I was just saying it like that, in the style of: "Yeah, I almost lost my life! Exclusive! DJ Clue!" As if the song was completely insignificant to me. That was disappointing.

**You recorded a song with Jay-Z for your album called "Never Let Me Down." What is the tune about?**

Oh wow, this song breaks me down every time I hear it. You have to know that about 95% of the album is based on real events, on my personal experiences. This is one of the raps that comes closest to real life. And it meant a lot to me. But since certain things in my life have changed, I have to adapt some passages in the text...

**Can you already tell me something about the track you produced for Jay-Z's "Black Album"?**

Uh, to be honest... (looks at the clock) Damn. Is it really almost eleven already? I have to go over and work on the piece right now. I made three beats for him. We're not sure which one we'll use yet. Maybe two will make it onto the album. I really like the beats; they've become really dramatic. When you hear them for the first time, you almost get goosebumps and think: "Wow, this is the last time I'm going to hear Jay-Z rap."

**Okay, then thank you for the interview!**

What? That's it already?

**Yes, or did you want to say something else?**

Uh... oh yes! I should actually soon be awarded the title of the best-dressed rapper. You may not have noticed yet, but the Louis Vuitton jacket that's lying behind you is mine; it has a real fur collar and was designed by my favorite designer, Marc Jacobs.
