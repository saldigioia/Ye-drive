# Merry, Hip West Shines at Jingle Ball

LOWELL — Even in music, there’s such a thing as a hometown advantage.

Clearly, that must explain why Boston’s own, the Click Five, closed Kiss-108 FM’s Jingle Ball at the Tsongas Arena instead of the artist Matt Siegel “Matty in the Morning” introduced as “the man who is bigger than anyone in the world.”

And that man was Kanye West, fresh off last week’s eight Grammy nominations. West, whose album, “Late Registration,” has been one of the year’s biggest, packed his 25-minute set with hits, opening with the dramatic “Diamonds From Sierra Leone.” Backed with a six-piece string section, a harpist, and a turntablist, West offered songs from both his latest album, and his multiple Grammy-winning debut, “The College Dropout.”

Still, despite performing such songs as “Heard ‘Em Say” and “Jesus Walks,” everyone was waiting for the irresistible “Gold Digger,” and Kanye milked the moment by leaving the stage, then returning for the song.

None of this is meant to take away from the Click Five’s effervescent performance. Dressed in white suits and ties and red shirts, they exuded an infectious energy with their polished pop songs.

Earlier in the evening they joined Boston Red Sox pitcher Bronson Arroyo for a rendition of the Standells’ evergreen “Dirty Water.” It was the best moment of Arroyo’s set, who played high-school-talent-show versions of the Goo Goo Dolls “Slide” and Pearl Jam’s “Black.” Bless his heart, though, for providing the evening with a much-needed bathroom break.

Perhaps it might have been an even better idea if Arroyo’s slot had been given to Gavin DeGraw, who gave a veins-a-poppin’ performance. Playing piano, guitar, and singing his heart out, DeGraw is a generous artist, whose talents are startling for anyone familiar only with his CDs. Live, his voice has a Stevie Wonder quality that never lapses into an impersonation, and he even tossed in bits of the Temptations’ “Papa Was a Rolling Stone” and Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Proud Mary.” And his own song, “Chariot,” was an absolute thriller.

Not so for Frankie J, who has a more that serviceable voice, but seemed far too intent on channeling Usher, right down to the dance moves, black suit, and aviator shades.

The madly popular Fall Out Boy provided the evening’s first profanity injection much to the chagrin of more than a few parents but also played a solid set, featuring hits, “Sugar, We’re Going Down” and “Dance, Dance.”
