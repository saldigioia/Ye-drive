# Kanye West in Control at 'Homecoming' Show

Right now life is very good for Kanye West, and if you run into him, he’ll be sure to let you know.

The Chicago South Side native’s two-hour homecoming show at the UIC Pavilion on Monday was a celebration of West’s hard-earned fortunes. His latest album is near the top of Billboard’s album chart after three months of release, his song “Gold Digger” is the No. 1 song in the country and he feels so good on this tour he’s scrolling quotes from detractors who claim he’s arrogant and soft — just so he could sit back and scoff.

West’s show, a combination of striking visuals, sweeping musicianship and a healthy dose of underdog humor, was that of a champion whose inspiration obviously comes from the inside, not the boilerplate routine of mainstream hip-hop. The young MC, who first rose to prominence as a hit-making producer, designed his show as if purposely to contrast Anger Management or other large-scale hip- hop tours that feed rap to the masses as humorless, redundant and 90 percent on tape.

This show was anything but assembled according to instructions. Instead of a posse, West assembled a 12-member band, which included a seven-member string section, a harpist, a percussionist and a pair of backup singers who vocalized the well-known samples in the songs. The band was divvied up onto four platforms resembling exaggerated Ikea boxes, with scrims as walls that occasionally served as projection screens.

Here was the setting for a show that, like his two albums, followed a personal narrative. Fans saw him rise from bed, dance to tunes on his clock radio (Ah-Ha’s “Take On Me” was a favorite) and then get preppy for his job at the Gap — in the former Evergreen Plaza, he made sure to point out. The accompanying songs — “Drive Slow” and “Spaceship” — detailed life working a dead-end job at minimum wage, a more relatable scenario than the gold-plated gangster fantasies pumped up by 50 Cent and others.

The hooks in the songs — “Touch the Sky,” “All Falls Down” — were big and irresistible. “Hey Mama” became the feel-good singalong while the menace of “Crack Music,” with its military beat, proved much heavier due to the fury raised by the hand drums and string section.

The show’s momentum was snarled twice, once when Chicago peer Common commandeered the stage. His continual shout-outs to the city and stripped-down performance were pure boredom. Then West stopped the show a few times to play DJ, essentially spinning some of his favorite records.

It provided a nice peek into his background, but essentially felt like killing time.

Opening was Fantasia Barrino, the “American Idol” winner whose “singing” voice was an obnoxious screech claiming Prince’s “Purple Rain” and Aerosmith’s “Dream On” as its victims.
