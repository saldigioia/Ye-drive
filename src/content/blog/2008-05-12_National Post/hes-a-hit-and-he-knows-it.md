# He's a Hit, and He Knows It

## Kanye West Is Returning to Canada to Show Us Just How Perfect He Really Is

The ego has landed. Or rather, it will touch down on Canadian soil on Tuesday, May 20 at Montreal's Bell Centre. At that time, rap's biggest mouth and biggest talent Kanye West will give local music fans a treat by making his long-awaited Montreal debut.

How long has it been? Long enough that West's longtime DJ, Montreal's own A-Trak, recently moved on to work on his own projects, and will not join him on stage.

Long enough for West to drop three albums of genre-defying/defining hip hop, turning it into hit-pop while retaining his creative clout: from 2004's charming The College Dropout to 2005's ambitious Late Registration and 2007's self-obsessed (but no less impressive) Graduation. And time enough for his much-vaunted fashion sense to evolve from freshman prim to new-school cool.

And long enough for the 30-year-old Chicago native to become one of pop culture's most monitored voices, grabbing headlines around the globe for his impulsive outbursts. He has complained loudly about any and all awards-show slights, from his 2004 miss for best new artist at the American Music Awards, to his storming of the stage at the 2006 MTV Europe Awards after not winning video of the year. Each of his albums has won a Grammy for rap album of the year; none has won album of the year.

West infamously entered politics in 2005, stating that "George Bush doesn't care about black people," following Hurricane Katrina. He decried homophobia in an MTV special earlier that year. Last Friday, he posted an outraged rant on his blog after an Entertainment Weekly reporter gave the opening performance of his current Glow in the Dark tour a B+.

"What's a B+ mean?" he wrote. "I'm an extremist. It's either pass or fail! A+ or F-! You know what, f--k you and the whole f--king staff!!!"

He has faced off against 50 Cent (when the pair simultaneously released albums on Sept. 11, 2007) and won; he was sued by Evil Knievel (for West's portrayal of the famed stuntman in his video for the song Touch the Sky; they settled out of court).

All of which makes his upcoming visit an exciting prospect. To see a larger-than-life pop culture icon such as West in the flesh, and in his prime, is a chance to see what all the fuss is about, to bypass the media frenzy and judge for oneself whether he is deserving of so much attention.

And/or it's simply a rare chance to see a big-league hip-hop show. Whatever the reasons, people are excited. The Montreal concert is all-but sold out, and there is rumour of a return engagement in August.

But lest we forget, it's also about the music. West got his start as a producer, working closely with New York rap kingpin Jay-Z, and making tracks for Alicia Keys and Janet Jackson. He has since produced albums for rapper Common and neo-soul singer John Legend (whom he signed as the first artist to his Good Music label).

West's use of sped-up old-soul samples became a much-copied trademark. He has since strayed far and wide in his search of new sounds, particularly on his latest album, where everyone from '70s German prog rock act Can to Steely Dan, Public Enemy, Elton John and French clubland duo Daft Punk are used to create the evocative backdrops to his raps.

Lyrically, he has lost the innocence that coloured his debut; Graduation finds West more obnoxious than ever, boasting about his jet-set lifestyle and prodigious talent ad nauseam. Yet his conflicted wordplay shows moments of self-awareness and self-doubt. In this light, his knee-jerk reactions to criticism become evidence of insecurity rather than conceit.

"I feel the pressure / Under more scrutiny / And what I do? / Act more stupidly," he says on Can't Tell Me Nothing.

Throughout, he displays an ingenuity and conversational fluidity that make the listener feel personally implicated in his narratives. The emerging impression is that of a rap superstar who is also your poor, misunderstood pal.

"I done played the underdog my whole career," he complains, on Barry Bonds. Soon after, with a wink: "I'm doing pretty good, as far as geniuses go / And I'm doing pretty 'hood in my pink Polo."

West fits in nowhere and everywhere. He makes music that rap fans appreciate, non-devotees convert to and critics acclaim, while pulling stunts everyone scoffs at. And he follows it all with a neurotic attention to detail.

"I'll never be / laid-back as this beat was," he admits on Everything I Am. Although it gets him into trouble time and again, West's ego is a driving force in his creativity, pushing him to outdo himself, to not rest on his laurels, and to keep trying new things.

Tirades like last weekend's blog post leave questions as to his sanity, or at least his ability to keep things in perspective. One hopes that these are extreme incidents, and that his curiosity exists in a healthier climate, closer to that which he described to Rolling Stone last September: "I try my best not to lie to myself," he said. "I try to keep my finger on the pulse of pop culture. I feel the vibe of what's going on in the community, what's happening in the hood, what's people's temperament toward me as a celebrity, as entertainment, as a rapper, as a musician."

West's live show features the rapper alone. A-Trak has not been replaced, leaving our hero solo within a futuristic stage set-up, his only companions being the crowd and a talking female spaceship named Jane. Light-show malfunctions had him livid earlier this month in Houston, the aftermath leading him to again take issue with the press: "Unfortunately for certain media outlets, you will never be able 2 'Michael Jackson' me," he said in a blog posting. "That means 2 make it seem like everything I do is so weird or out of place ... they always try 2 make it seem like everything is about my ego! That joke is getting old. At a certain point you have 2 respect that I'm one of the last artist that still cares about the fans having the best time of there [sic] lives!"

Somewhere in this ongoing to and fro -- in West's fight against the forces of darkness out to steal his shine -- is the futile struggle of an extremely talented pop superstar to control every aspect of his public image.

In seeing a threat in every less-than-glowing line written about him, and injustice in every unwon award, West gives power to the peripheral elements of an industry in which he is a driving force.

To put it into the collegiatethemed context of his discography, he needs to do like the title of his latest album and graduate. Move on. Don't worry about grades -- school's out. - Kanye West performs on May 21 at Toronto's Molson Ampitheatre, with Rihanna, N. E. R. D. and Lupe Fiasco.
