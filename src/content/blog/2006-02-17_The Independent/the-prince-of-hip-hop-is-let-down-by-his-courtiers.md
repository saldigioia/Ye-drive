# The Prince of Hip-Hop Is Let Down by His Courtiers

The abiding problem of hip-hop performance is how exactly do you make the spectacle of one or two blokes talking into microphones while their mate mucks about on turntables into something, well, spectacular?

Many have tried and failed. Public Enemy notably use their camp pseudo-military dance troupe, the Security of the First World, to add entertainment value to Chuck D’s hectoring.

Eminem presented a carnival show. Kanye West, the current reigning prince of hip-hop - indeed, the Best International Male if the Brits are to be believed - goes some way further, by filling the stage with a string section featuring a hyper-active violinist in a diaphanous see-through dress, and an almost inaudible harpist, along with the mandatory DJ on the decks.

It’s ambitious, certainly, though it’s arguable whether the MEN Arena is exactly suited to the subtle timbres of strings. As it happened, it wasn’t the sound so much as the visuals - specifically, the miscued video backdrops - that caused most problems.

The visuals were fine to begin with, the show opening with the video for “Touch The Sky” (Kanye as canyon-jumping daredevil rocketeer) behind the unlit string section. Hundreds of camera phones immediately lit up the Arena - and Kanye wasn’t even in the house yet.

When he finally appeared for “Diamonds”, the response was tumultuous, and Kanye responded to the acclaim, loping back and forth across the stage with the gait of a dribbling basketball player, to try to reach as many fans as possible.

Unlike some rappers, he’s not stand-offish in the least, and there was a genuine rapport between artist and audience that was best exemplified during one of the several video malfunctions, when he busked a few old numbers off the cuff while repairs were hurriedly carried out.

No one seemed too put out - indeed, the crowd saw their chance to get involved and started chanting his name through the confusion. “It’s our first show,” said the star, who seemed unwilling to let any song continue if it was less than perfectly presented.

I lost count of the number of times he stopped tracks after a few bars. On one occasion, he refused to continue with a track until the Spaceman video he’d prepared was shown. When it was finally screened, it showed Kanye making an astronaut suit look as cuddly and innocent as his trademark teddy bear. “See, I told you it was cool,” he said, though it hardly seemed worth the wait.

Another time, “Roses” was abandoned completely, and the finale of “Touch The Sky” was halted because: “This song is about the sky, and you can’t have the stage in darkness”. The lights came on and the song restarted.

At one point he stopped “Crack Music” because someone in the crowd was putting him off. “I appreciate your enthusiasm brother, but...”

The fragmentary nature of the show wasn’t helped by the star’s frequent departures to change sneakers or don a newjacket, and there was an odd interlude when he had the DJ play snatches of old hits, like a school disco. But despite the interruptions and glitches, or maybe because of them, there was a rare spirit and optimism that touched the audience deeply. It’ll be a long time before we see another Arena show of quite such spontaneity.
