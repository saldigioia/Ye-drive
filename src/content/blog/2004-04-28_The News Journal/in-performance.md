# In Performance

Kanye West turned down few opportunities to stroke his ego at the Electric Factory Friday, in a concert that felt like it could be taking place at a student center.

Fans stood in long lines in the pouring rain just to see him perform, except for a few people who thought Jay-Z was going to make a cameo appearance.

The show was a stop on West's "School Spirit" tour, which has already hit college campuses nationwide, including a gig at the University of Delaware's Bob Carpenter Center. The concert also featured performances by Dilated Peoples and Young Gunz.

During the show, West continually reminded that he was a great rapper and producer - as though the audience was unaware. He made sure everyone at the concert knew he produced "You Don't Know My Name" by Alicia Keyes, "Stand Up" by Ludacris, and "Get By" by Talib Kweli. He performed snippets of each.

West was always his own best promoter. If it weren't for his own scrambling, he may not have wangled a deal with Roc-A-Fella Records, an ordeal he chronicled onstage in "Last Call," a song from "The College Dropout."

Some call him arrogant. Others say he's just confident. Whichever it is, he epitomizes the rap industry's proverbial "self-made man." And there's still no denying the brother's skills.

The show ran like a continuous thought, more like a stream of consciousness than a live performance.

At one point, it was as though he were chronicling the history of blues music. After performing the hit single "Jesus Walks," Kanye followed with "I'll Fly Away,‚Äù accompanied by his band, comprised of a pianist, violinist, and guitarist. He followed with the blues-inspired "Spaceship," which chronicled his experience working at The Gap while he was in college. Next came "School Spirit," which is about college sororities and fraternities.

He ended the show with "Last Call," during which Roc-A-Fella CEO Damon Dash and fellow recording artist Neef from Young Gunz pretended they were about to spray a bottle of Grey Goose vodka into the crowd - a little distracting, to say the least.

Young Gunz, second to take the stage, went on before West. Their commercial appeal emanated throughout the set, which was riddled with intermittent shout-outs to "the Roc" and to the "sexy females."

And, of course, no commercial rap performance would be complete without an ass-shaking contest.

After performing "Better Love," the rap duo pulled scantily clad ladies onto the stage to shake their stuff. The winners won a chance to "hang out" with the Young Gunz after the show.

It just seemed so anti-Kanye.

Guest appearances by Dash and rap artist Freeway, who is originally from Philadelphia, were the highlights of the group's set.

Dash stood center-stage, whipped out a cell phone, and supposedly called up fellow Roc-A-Fella artist Beanie Sigel, who faces attempted murder charges.

"If he's on trial, we're all on trial because we're family, so we all feel it," Dash said to the audience.

The most surprising part of the show came from rapper Supernatural, a guest artist who gave an impromptu appearance during Dilated People's opening set.

Supernatural had audience members hold up random objects from their pockets. His challenge was to incorporate them into his freestyle. The crowd roared as he incorporated the items they produced, which included a cell phone, a Black & Mild cigar, a Duracell battery, and an asthma medicine dispenser, to name a few.

Dilated People's member Evidence was not at the show. Group member Oasis and turntablist DJ Baboo performed songs from their latest albums, "Neighborhood Watch" and "Expansion Team," in his absence.
