# Shades of Oedipus for Hip-Hop Titans

SEATTLE — Four years ago, Drake played his first New York show, at S.O.B.’s. Huddled up in a private area at the rear of the club was Kanye West, presumably curious as to how secure his own future was. Drake had been making noise as the first demonstrably viable post-Kanye rapper, one for whom emotional excavation was a virtue, one who’d mainlined Mr. West’s middle-class sensibilities and created a new sound on that foundation.

In a way, Drake was Mr. West’s first child — an eventual competitor, but also a validation of his vision. Together — well, in parallel — they’ve spent the last few years remaking hip-hop’s center, emphasizing melody, feeling and post-street virtues while stuck in a subliminal Oedipal psychic struggle.

Both rappers began their new tours last weekend, Drake on Friday at the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh, and Mr. West at KeyArena in Seattle on Saturday. Yes, Jay Z will tour later this year, with his gleaming, Cadillac-sized road spectacle, the last mogul in a post-oligopoly age. But it’s not to be taken lightly that two of the year’s biggest hip-hop tours are by artists who are the genre’s most tortured, most aesthetically flexible, most risk friendly.

Their approaches couldn’t have been more different, though: Drake, lean and eager; Mr. West, bombastic and ornate.

The combustible Mr. West is rap’s most theatrical figure — he performed most of this show in a mask, often accompanied by a dozen bodystocking-clad female dancers and, at the end of the night, a Jesus look-alike who told him, “That’s all I need from you to show people the light.”

In June, Mr. West released “Yeezus” (Roc-A-Fella/Def Jam), his sixth solo album, and perhaps his harshest; the music is icy and sharp, an almost complete abnegation of the lush soul he first made his name with. It’s Mr. West at his most direct and pungent.

No surprise, then, that this was a cathartic, bruising show from the beginning. On “New Slaves,” Mr. West unleashed one guttural scream after the next, and on “Mercy,” he jumped up and down so forcefully that the stagefloor shook. Minutes later, on “Power,” he climbed to the top of the glacier-like stage centerpiece, stripped off his shirt and rapped with carnal vigor.

More than ever, Mr. West is performing with the full of his body; he made maximum use of the space, several times lying out flat on the floor while still rapping. On “Coldest Winter,” about the death of his mother, he sat at the edge of the stage, slumped, as snow blanketed him. On “I Am a God,” the dancers hoisted him to the sky. Halfway through the night, Mr. West’s pants split at the crotch, but he soldiered on.

Where Mr. West was spiteful and transfixing, Drake was uncommonly smooth, a grinning champion at ease on his throne. Mr. West, through sheer weight of history, may still cast a longer shadow over pop culture than Drake, but this has been the year of Drake’s ascendance to the peak of mainstream hip-hop, its biggest seller and influence.

If it’s numbers you believe, Drake wins hands down. His third album, “Nothing Was The Same” (Young Money/Cash Money/Republic), was released last month and sold more than 650,000 copies in its first week, the second highest total of the year. “Yeezus” sold about half that number. Drake has had two Top 10 hits from this album: “Started From the Bottom” and “Hold On, We’re Going Home.” Mr. West’s highest charting single this year is “Gone,” a 2005 song used in a hit viral video; nothing from “Yeezus” cracked the Top 40.

In August, Mr. West made an appearance at OVO Fest, the annual concert Drake hosts in Toronto, an implicit concession to hip-hop’s new center of power. Drake described Mr. West as “the reason I’m rapping,” and Mr. West told the crowd that it was pressure from Drake that led him and Jay Z to work hard on their album “Watch the Throne” (Roc-A-Fella/Def Jam/Roc Nation).

No wonder Drake is in a comfortable space. Where Mr. West embodies turmoil on stage, Drake telegraphs exuberance, even if his music generally eschews that. A fluent showman, he bounds across the stage with palpable cheer, dances with goofy élan and makes an abundance of eye contact. And when he raps, he sometimes slows things down just a bit, for clarity, as he did on “Versace” and “HYFR,” an almost conspiratorial tactic of inclusion.

And that’s to say nothing of the retail politics of his show-ending segment, where he talks to individual audience members: “That dress was the right choice for you tonight, baby, I swear;” “Don’t let them tell you Drake too emotional, Drake too soft.”

Drake’s show was much closer to a traditional hip-hop concert than Mr. West’s, even though Drake himself is far from the typical rapper. The pulpy emotion that suffuses his best songs was largely missing here, in favor of a dogged, ambitious energy. On “The Language,” he devoted almost as much attention to his facial expressions as his rhymes, and on “Crew Love” and “The Motto,” he looked like a kid told he could unwrap his Christmas presents early. Drake may be in his most traditionalist hip-hop period right now, but he remains a romantic at heart. His singing was placid, small breaks from the storm. At times, like on the silky “Hold On, We’re Going Home,” he was as soothing and aquatic as Maze featuring Frankie Beverly, or the Gap Band.

Mr. West, by contrast, is in a harsh industrial phase. While Drake doesn’t present himself as being above his audience, with Mr. West there is an implied force field. Difficulty and inaccessibility are parts of his charm. Over the course of the night, though, his pace slowed, his body speaking fatigue, and by show’s end, he was slapping hands with fans in the front, his guard finally fully down.

Perhaps he was truly tired: the concert began almost two hours late, and didn’t end until well after 1 a.m. (The second nights of both tours were postponed, presumably because of technical issues.) And there were opening-night glitches. During “Runaway,” the MPC that had been brought out on stage for Mr. West to play appeared to malfunction. “Everybody fired!” he barked.

For Drake, the hiccups came a few days before the show, when rumors began to spread that Future, one of the openers, whose weepy cyborg music owes a great deal to Drake, was being removed from the tour because of some impertinent things he said to Billboard about his forthcoming album as compared to Drake’s.

Still, there Future was on Friday night, happily performing his opening set, and then joining Drake for a couple of songs. On “Honest” and “Same Damn Time,” Drake rapped along like a fan with a front-row ticket. For the moment, the two were allies, but you never can tell when the son might go prodigal.
