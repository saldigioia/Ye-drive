# Up From the Streets

## Seven Years Ago, When Scott Schuman Started Uploading Pictures He'd Taken of New Yorkers Who Caught His Eye, There Was Nothing Quite Like It. Now the Sidewalk Sees More Flash Than a Prada Show, and Any Art Student With an iPhone Can Snap His Way to Blogging Fame. Alex Pappademas Trails the King of Street Style From Manhattan to Milan—Fashion Week by Bike!—and Gets the Secrets to Staying in the Picture

Maybe you're an impossibly gamine French girl in a little leather jacket and lunettes parfaites comme Buddy Holly; maybe you're a businessman whose chalk-stripe lapel rolls just right, an envelope-pushing hipster living your conviction that jodhpurs are underrated, or a barber or a child or a shepherd who has it, in some way, going on. You're effortlessly stylish; you don't try, you just are, or you're able to make it look like you just are. Your Statement Hat is not wearing you, even though it's the kind of Statement Hat that might try. You are not a life-support system for your beard. If you're any of these things, Scott Schuman has been looking for you. For seven years, he has been taking pictures of well-dressed people on the street and posting them on his blog, The Sartorialist. He's a hunter of free-range sprezzatura, pounding the pavements of Manhattan and the boulevards of Paris and the cobblestones of Milan, a spy-movie montage's worth of postcard cities, New Delhi and Berlin and Rio, anywhere he might encounter style roaming wild.

Today in Florence it's different, though—today some of his favorite subjects have come to him. They've come from America, from England and Spain and even Japan. Most of them have made multiple appearances on Schuman's blog; most of them have never met before, but they seem to recognize one another on some tribal level. They all look amazing. Schuman stands in the street in front of the little trattoria where he's treating them all to lunch, taking pictures as they arrive. They strike rakishly unposed-looking poses, holding their cigarettes as straight as exclamation points. They have rich Corinthian-leather tans. They have lace handkerchiefs in the pockets of their immaculately tailored jackets. They have elegant, unironic mustaches. They have spectacular beards—wizardy, fishermanly beards.

They're heavy dudes in their respective fields—menswear retail and tailoring, mostly—but none of them are the kind of big-time designers whose names appear on people's underwear and in rap songs. They're not models, or movie stars. Many of them are pushing 50 or 60. And yet they've all become figures of cultish fascination to young style bloggers worldwide, prized as the walking embodiment of a deeply old-school, untrendy-and-thereby-deeply-trendy approach to getting dressed.

Like Lino Ieluzzi. These days Lino runs Al Bazar, a forty-year-old men's shop in Milan. Before that, Schuman says, he did a lot of other things. He fixed watches. He was maybe a hairstylist-gigolo for a while, like Warren Beatty in Shampoo. He's a regular on the blog: Lino with one foot up on a concrete berm, Lino smoking with a Heineken in his hand. Today, Lino's wearing a suit in a mathematical combination of plaids, so tailored it fits like armor. His necktie has a lucky number 7 on it. If you want to buy a suit from Lino, you have to go to Milan. Even if he's tailored a suit for you before and has your measurements, Lino won't FedEx you another one. You have to go there in person, kiss the ring.

And yet Lino's an international style icon now, thanks to Schuman's pictures of him. So are Hirofumi Kurino, co-founder of the Japanese retail chain United Arrows, and clothier Luciano Barbera, and Carlos Castillo, who owns a store called Man 1924 in Madrid, and all the rest. "I've never felt like such an Oscar in a room full of Felixes," Schuman says to me. This is a ridiculous statement. Schuman looks immaculate, too. Trim black blazer, a scarf he probably test-knotted a few times in the mirror. He's American, pugnaciously handsome, five feet four, kinda looks like a bantamweight Lance Armstrong. I watch him say the Oscar/Felix thing to Bruce Pask from T Magazine. He is saying it to everyone from a country where they had The Odd Couple.

Inside, Schuman gives a toast. He tells everyone they're the core of what he does on The Sartorialist, that they make it possible. In Indiana, where he grew up, the closest thing to fashion was a mall that had both a Gap and a Chess King1, and he does the blog, he says, for kids just like him, "imagining what a world like this would be like. Now these guys have a chance to really see that, hopefully on a daily basis, and I really have you guys to thank for that." So, cheers, he says, and then tells everybody not to pay attention to him, because he'll be walking around shooting.

And then a guy in a white tuxedo jacket walks in, and even after Schuman introduces him, there are definitely some people who don't know who the guy in the white tuxedo jacket is or what he does for a living, which is funny, because the guy in the white tuxedo jacket is Kanye West.

Kanye is late. In addition to the jacket, Kanye's wearing a tan scarf. A gold-and-diamond grill flashes on his bottom front teeth. He's got a four-man video crew with him, but they hang respectfully back; all things being equal, it's a fairly subtle entrance, Kanye-wise. What's interesting is that once he's seated—next to Terron Schaefer, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Saks—Kanye goes quiet for a minute, forks up straccetti from a plate that has materialized before him as if teleported there, and chews it meditatively. He's listening. Apparently the genius switch actually does have an "off" position, or at least a dimmer.

How many times a year is Kanye in a room where he's not the center of attention, not counting those moments when he's in a room with Jay-Z or Oprah? Five times? Three? This is proof that on some level Schuman has actually altered the polarity of the universe, that he can create a room where this is the case, where being Luciano Barbera is as important as being Kanye West.

Schuman never seems to sit down for more than a second. He's moving, shooting, directing the videographer who's capturing this luncheon for the blog. When I ask him how he thinks it's going, he says, "Nobody seems to be mad at me, so that's good"; he tells me later that this is the first party he's hosted since college, because he's never lived in an apartment that could accommodate one.

Everybody's gadgeting, trading contact information, and snapping mobile-device pictures of one another. Finally Kanye speaks up.

"I think I'm going to start getting into photography," he says.

"Stop," purrs Terron Schaefer, as if this is the most perfectly goddamn delightful thing anybody has ever said out loud. "Renaissance man," he says to Kanye.

Kanye talks about how the flash on the BlackBerry blows out people's faces when you try to take their picture with it. He says he wants to invent a camera where the flash comes at the subject from the side, somehow. He says this to no one and everyone, as if maybe someone here will take a note, jump on this sideways-flash project immediately.

Kanye talks for most of the next hour. About the fashion writers who panned his first women's collection, in which he paired leather booty shorts with fur as a summer look. (They were wrong.) About the architecture of Florence and what it does for a man's understanding of how short our time is on this planet. (A lot.) Jesus. Paintings. Swords.

"I was saying completely off-the-wall shit," Kanye tells me on his way out the door. "Just shit that nobody believes in but me." He asks not to be quoted on any of it, then tells me, "Scott gave me my first opportunity to be photographed in a different light than the normal rap way. So anytime Scott does anything, I don't care where I am in the world, I'll be there."

Schuman grew up wanting to be Giorgio Armani. Watching Style with Elsa Klensch on CNN. Watching Fashion File with Tim Blanks. Stockpiling old L'Uomo Vogues. He learned enough studying fashion design in college to realize he'd never be Armani, moved to New York, did the executive-training program at Bloomingdale's, got a numbers-guy job at Valentino, then opened his own showroom to market the work of young designers like Peter Som. Shortly after September 11, losing money, losing interest, Schuman closed that showroom, walked away from the fashion business with nothing but a nagging sense that he was an artist who'd yet to find his medium. The Schumans' nanny went to Honduras for surgery and never came back; Schuman became a stay-at-home dad, watching his two young daughters while his then wife, Christa, a designer at The Limited, went to work.

He had a little digital camera; he'd chase his girls around a little park on Bleecker Street, running and shooting, which made him realize he liked taking pictures. He started walking around the city shooting the usual amateur-photography-class stuff—chess-game spectators in Chinatown, public-court ballers, vendors at the Fulton Fish Market, the occasional interestingly tragic homeless person. But he was drawn back to fashion. The way old men wore their old-man hats and secondhand suits. In 2005, inspired by the picture-plus-comment-thread format of blogs like Design*Sponge, the tailoring-nerd banter on the message board Ask Andy About Clothes, and the crackle of the sports-talk radio he listened to all day, he started The Sartorialist.

At one point, while we were sitting at a bar in Florence, Schuman pulled up the page-view stats from a story in The New York Times about the new breed of men's-style bloggers. The highest-trafficked site mentioned was blogger Michael Williams's A Continuous Lean, with 470,000 page views per month. Schuman's site does almost that much every day.

But Schuman's reach isn't just about numbers. Some of the earliest photos he posted on the blog were pictures of big-time magazine editors. Back then, magazine editors who weren't Anna Wintour weren't accustomed to being paparazzi'd outside fashion shows; nobody took pictures of them, except maybe the legendary New York Times fashion photographer Bill Cunningham2 and the occasional stringer from an obscure Japanese style magazine. Editors would ask him, when he'd take their picture, who he was and what he was doing; relationships developed. The blog grew. Schuman started to seem like somebody who'd figured out something about how to do fashion journalism online that had thus far eluded print magazines.

Before long he had his own page in GQ, also called The Sartorialist. That relationship ended in 2010, but it opened doors. These days companies like Burberry tap him to shoot Sartorialist-style ad campaigns. He gets paid to go stand on a stage at Apple and talk about himself. He reportedly got a six-figure advance for a collection of his photos (The Sartorialist, Penguin Books, 2009, bricklike), which he earned back and then some; a second book, of previously unpublished pictures, is in the works. Now, when he goes to fashion shows, he shoots from the front row.

Schuman's aesthetic began, at least in part, as an outsider's fantasy of intimacy with the world of fashion. Especially in the early pictures—the smaller, less luminous ones he took with his old camera—it's as if he's trying to impose himself on that world symbolically by shooting its leading lights in the same casual way he shot ordinary people. Like he's trying to blur the line separating the insiders from the out. It was the perfect approach: Nobodies logging on from their own private Indianas got the illusion of access to the fashion-show tents or an imaginary trip to imaginary Paris. Somebodies got a magic mirror that both subtly affirmed their fairest-of-them-all status and broadcast it to the world.

The Internet—as people never tire of telling us, via the Internet—demolishes long-standing hierarchies, sows democracy, takes power out of the hands of elites and middlemen and redistributes it to scrappy upstarts with big dreams. Schuman, a style fanatic literally without portfolio, starts his little blog and forces the fashion-industrial complex (the designers who dictate style and the magazines that help sell it) to take notice. But the story of Schuman's rise is just as much a story about how those hierarchies evolve to assimilate insurgents when it serves their interests to do so.

Inside the vast pentagonal footprint of the Fortezza da Basso, a sixteenth-century fort that now houses a large convention center, the second-to-last day of this winter's Pitti Immagine Uomo trade fair is about to begin. Stand outside in the morning and you can watch the Pitti-goers arrive, an ostentation of human peacocks greeting the day with their feathers at full swag.

They come dragging wheeled suitcases—full of merchandise or contracts, depending if they're buying or selling—over the cobblestones. They come in trousers rolled to expose just the right amount of man ankle to the world. They come in vintage workwear, like they're going to go eat lunch on a girder. They come in shiny Moncler puffer vests over suit jackets and Max Fischer blazer-and-tie combos and blue suede bucks and thick-soled Frankenstein wingtips and Campbell's-tomato red pants and perfectly knotted Burberry scarves. They come in the kind of nut-huggingly slim-cut khakis you don't normally see on men who also have jowls like Paul Sorvino. They come in shawl-collar toggle-closure sweater coats a bit like the one Donald Sutherland puts on, sans pants, after making sweet love to Peter Riegert's girlfriend in Animal House.

Everyone who comes to Pitti has to pass through the same ancient brick archway, in front of which the street narrows like the neck of a flask, creating a de facto red-carpet-arrivals situation for the fashionable foot traffic with business inside the fort. There was a time when Schuman would have had this scene to himself. Now there's usually a contingent of upstart street-style blogger-photographer types—all acolyte-competitors crowding a lane Schuman more or less invented—jockeying for position outside, looking for the angles, frequently poaching one another's shots. A Continuous Lean's Michael Williams refers to the space as Dealey Plaza: "There's, like, triangulated fire in there."

On one level, they're competition, pure and simple. But Schuman also wants them to succeed. He wants more advertisers to funnel money they currently spend on print ads into dedicated blog-ad budgets instead; for that to happen, independent bloggers need to become as central to the fashion mediascape as magazines. To put it in Daniel Plainview terms, he wants the overall milkshake to be bigger so he can drink more of it. (The shake is already pretty rich. Schuman assures me with a grin that his site turns a healthy profit, and in a 2011 interview he said his long-term sponsorship deals with American Apparel and Net-a-Porter were worth "more than a quarter million and less than a half million.")

Snapshots from The Sartorialist.

Schuman finally shows up, logs a polite interval of chitchat with Vietnamese-Canadian photographer and GQ contributor Tommy Ton, then heads for the arch. He spots a big-shouldered Jack Donaghy-esque guy in a gray suit and scarf, lighting a cigarette on his way into the fort. He catches the guy's eye and says, "Hey, Ron."

"Hey, Scott," says Ron, politely but without slowing down.

"Happy New Year, buddy," Schuman says.

Ron is Ron Frasch, the president and chief merchandising officer at Saks Incorporated. Schuman says they actually worked together years ago when Schuman was at Valentino, but Frasch didn't pay much attention to who he was. Later on, during Schuman's stay-at-home-dad period, they were introduced at a party. "He's looking right over my head,"3 Schuman says, "and I remember thinking, I'm gonna make this fucking blog so he looks at me when I'm talking to him."

Inside the Fortezza, Schuman moves in and out of the showrooms, pretending to look at clothes but really looking at the people selling them. He shoots a guy in a blue smock eating a crème-filled croissant, because he looks like a butcher on his lunch hour. He shoots a 16-year-old fashion blogger with a topknot of curly-fries dreadlocks who clutches his Louis Vuitton iPad case to his chest like a pining schoolgirl. He tries to lead people away from the glossy signage of the trade-show buildings and put them up against old, crumbly walls whenever he can.

"It places them in a context," he says. When I point out that by positioning them so you can't see they're at a fashion-trade show, he's actually, technically obscuring the context, he says, "Yeah—it's definitely a curated context. It's my altered reality."

Just after dusk, we're sitting outside at Caffé Gilli, in the Piazza della Repubblica. Schuman's relaxed; the light is gone, so there's nothing more to shoot today. We're drinking Negronis. The one thing I know about Schuman is that sometimes, when he's had a few drinks, he becomes an unbelievably wonderful quote machine.

From "Sex and the Sartorialist," written by Amy Verner, published in the Toronto Globe and Mail on July 25, 2009:

> Q. You look fit—just not big like a quarterback.

> 

> A. I'm pretty good at the sex. And pretty good at picture taking. That's about it. Garance4 is pretty happy. And the hotel-room neighbours are pretty pissed. You can write that; that's totally fine with me.

> 

> Q. You want people to know you're good in bed?

> 

> A. Yeah. Yeah.

To be fair, the "big like a quarterback" part of the question probably qualifies as "leading the witness, after realizing the witness has had a few too many book-party drinks," but this is how Schuman answered a completely unrelated question:

> Q: What camera do you use?

> 

> A: I use a Canon EOS 5D Mark II. It shoots high-definition video even though I haven't figured out how to do that. But I'm still really good in bed.

That's about as much information as I need about his sexual prowess, but I'm still hoping he'll get a little tuned up and say something controversial, something Internet-insurgent-y, perhaps about how he won't rest until he's used his ever growing influence to break GQ's stranglehold on the world of men's fashion, because that would be an awesome thing to have him saying in a GQ story. But he won't go there. He does say this about magazines in general, though:

"It shocks me when young kids still say, 'I want to do a magazine,' " he says. "Really? Do you want to do a magazine because you want to be an editor—what you think that life is, that romance—or do you want to communicate? Because if you want to communicate, why the fuck would you put all those obstacles in your path and have to print pages, as opposed to going right on the Internet and actually communicating?"

Schuman and I take a train to Milan that night, and there's trouble as soon as we get there. The taxis are on strike; the private-car services are, too, in solidarity.

"This is really going to fuck everyone up," Schuman says. Not us, though. He has a plan. The next day, after breakfast at the hotel, we rent bikes, and by nine o'clock, while the international fashion establishment is still trying to beg, borrow, or steal transportation to the shows, we're bombing through traffic, dodging the streetcars, ignoring snarly traffic patterns shaped by the canals that used to run through this city back in Michelangelo's day. I'm wearing New Balance and a fisherman's sweater my mom bought me, but I feel like an outlaw. Fuck you, Milan! Fuck you, fashion!

When we get to the Costume National show, nobody's there yet, and they're still testing the sound system, blasting a huge empty warehouse space with New Order at F-15-engine volume. Worried men and women with backstage-pass laminates around their necks are outside on the sidewalk with Oh my God where are all the models looks on their faces, because all the models are kids from Belgium or Iowa or wherever, and a lot of them can't navigate Milan without a cab either.

The street photographers have made it out, though. At least seven or eight of them. They're posted up on the corner, where the mid-morning sun washes arriving fashion-editor types in gold. Look—here comes Anna Dello Russo, fashion director at large and creative consultant for Vogue Japan! Click click click click click click click.

The Costume National show: It's, um, great? I guess? Men wearing inside-out trench coats like bat wings; men who look like Tilda Swinton; men who look like Ed from Northern Exposure except with cheekbones that could open cans; neck tats and gauge piercings; Destroyer's "Leave Me Alone." At Schuman's suggestion, I stand near the exit so I can get out quick the minute it's over. Schuman's seated at the far end of the runway, one hundred feet farther from the door, but by the time I get there, he's already outside and I've lost him in the crowd. Cabless fashion folk are on their cell phones, looking for their rides, wandering in the street alongside double-parked cars. It's a chic Italian traffic jam, just like in 8 1/2 , and it's in this already pretty Fellini-esque context that we meet the Pink Ladyman.

Schuman's in the middle of shooting the Pink Ladyman when I spot him again. The Pink Ladyman is an Asian guy in a blond wig under a pink bowler hat that matches his pants, a kind of lacy-sheer white Blanche Devereaux blouse, Pan-Cake makeup over skin stippled with acne, blue contacts.

Schuman comes back over to me grinning, pulling up the Pink Ladyman's picture on his camera's LCD screen, crowing, "That is a Diane Arbus shot."

He looks sad, he looks fierce, he looks—

"Stoned, I think," Schuman says. "And you know, that's the fashion malaise. His dream is to come out from a show, have everyone want to take his picture, and then be like, 'Ugh. I cannot...!' His dream is to be Kate Moss, to be bored with everyone taking his picture. 'This beauty is a curse.'

"And the other sad part is, he's doing very much a knockoff of Bryanboy," Schuman says, referring to the fey Filipino style blogger Bryan Yambao, who's known for covering fashion events while dressed like a bored housewife from the future. "So everyone in this room—" he motions to the building we've just left—"goes, 'Oh, he's [just] doing a Bryanboy.' So that adds a level of sadness."

It's the only picture Schuman takes in my presence that has something abject about it, the one that lays bare something broken and needy in its subject. Schuman likes to say every picture he takes is the first line of a story. Maybe not a thousand words. Maybe like fifteen words. A man trying to make himself disappear wore his fabulousness like a bad toupee.

He probably won't put the guy's picture on the blog, he says, to protect him from getting ripped in the comments section. He's careful about that; he'll sometimes wade in and tell someone who's being not-so-chic to take it elsewhere. "I don't want people to be mean to him," he says.

And maybe this is the weakness of his work: We think of Diane Arbus as a towering artist (if a pretty morally problematic one) because she wasn't afraid of grotesquerie—because she was drawn to it, the same way we're drawn to it as spectators, and because she wasn't afraid of the consequences of showing someone that way. Her work feels real because ugly always feels realer. The only gear Schuman has is admiration; he portrays people in the most flattering possible light, literally and figuratively. And maybe that's sycophancy, but maybe it's gentleness, an unwillingness to expose the world of fashion as a pageant of attention hunger born of insecurity.

Obviously that insecurity isn't unique to fashion people—the nagging sense that we're weird and flawed and broken, and the impulse to hide that from the world at all costs by wearing the right thing, is one of the most basic things you and I and Schuman have in common as humans lucky enough to not have to worry about things like survival. And if Schuman, in his photographs, doesn't try to cut through that, if he makes himself a participant in his subjects' self-concealment, an accomplice, if he actually embroiders the lie by creating an imaginary world where it can live—well, look, you can see that as cowardly or you can see it as humane.

Off to Dolce & Gabbana! Schuman's wondering where his seat is going to be. Last season Dolce asked Schuman to host a party for them during Pitti Uomo, for free, and he said no—not so much because they wouldn't pay him, he says, but because Pitti Uomo's his busiest period and they wanted him to host a party at four o'clock in the afternoon, prime shooting time—and so they wouldn't give him and Garance tickets to their womenswear show later that year. And then the day after that show, someone from Dolce & Gabbana actually e-mailed Schuman, he says, and asked him if he'd come to this fence-mending breakfast meeting, and Schuman didn't even write them back.

It's complicated. Dolce & Gabbana put Schuman—along with Doré, Tommy Ton, and Bryanboy—in the front row at a D&G spring/summer show in 2009, even gave them loaner laptops on little podiums, and it was the first time anybody had ever given up that kind of real estate in Anna Wintour territory to the insurgents from the Internet, and it's still cited all over the place as a paradigm-shift moment for fashion journalism. Women's Wear Daily ran a picture of it, which you can still find online. There's Bryanboy, computer-screen light reflected in his trademark Kim Jong-il glasses, which in this context look more like virtual-reality goggles from the '90s, which in turn make Bryanboy look like he's fully embracing the role of blogger sideshow. And here are Garance and Tommy, obviously enjoying the moment to no end, grinning at one of the laptops like they're watching a particularly entertaining kitten video—Tommy's wearing shorts, for God's sake. And here's Schuman on the far right, squinting hard at his iPhone screen like he's trying to send an e-mail telekinetically. He looks pissed. Humiliated, even.

Laptops. On little podiums. Like they were going to be sitting there typing fucking blog posts. Do they give Anna Wintour a mimeograph machine so she can crank out an issue of Vogue right there? No they do not. And actually having a laptop on a little podium in front of him (a) made it harder for Schuman to do what he would normally do in that situation, which is take pictures, and—one gets the strong sense that this was the real problem—(b) set him apart pretty decisively from the real front-row people, who didn't need some kind of blogger affirmative-action program. I ask Schuman if he felt like he'd been seated at the kids' table, and he says he did.

"They got a humongous amount of press," Schuman says. "Look, we brought the bloggers in and gave them the front row. Look at the dancing-monkey bloggers! I could barely bring myself to sit down." It's true, in the picture he almost looks like he's trying to escape. "Like, 'Ugh, I don't want everyone looking at us.' Like, Oh, look at the cute bloggers! Isn't that cute! Are they playing Angry Birds? When you've got Ron Frasch behind you going, 'I spent two fucking million dollars on D&G's last

collection, and I'm sitting here? For these little schmucks?' "

Of course, Frasch didn't actually say anything to this effect. "Ron was very chic about it," Schuman says. And a month or so later, he calls me at home to make sure his gripes about D&G are contextualized, saying he's come to understand that signiori Dolce and Gabbana themselves had nothing to do with the decision to bar him from the women's shows after the party-hosting thing, that it was a decision made by one set of functionaries, that other functionaries have since stepped in to smooth things over, and that all is once again chic between Schuman and D&G. (Dolce & Gabbana declined to comment for this article.)

But it's a touchy situation. Schuman has to maintain the appearance of impartiality, the sense that he can be honest with his audience about fashion in a way that traditional fashion magazines can't, because they're beholden to advertisers in a way that he isn't, but also because they're edited by people who for reasons both social and professional don't want to risk losing their front-row seats at fashion shows. But now that the sidewalks outside the shows are crowded with street photographers doing a version of Schuman's shtick, now that just being a blogger as opposed to a magazine person isn't enough to set Schuman apart, he has to make sure his relationships with the Dolce & Gabbanas of the world remain cordial, because his status in the world that he created depends on him being the one guy in that world with an all-access pass, the one guy who can blow by the clipboard thugs at the door of every fashion show—leaving his competitors outside to fight amongst themselves—and sit in that front row with the chosen people.

So stonewalling D&G was really just an experiment: Could Schuman pull the power move and still get a good seat at this year's shows? He can. We get inside, and a D&G functionary guides him to a front-row seat, and white-gloved model-slash-waiters circulate with champagne, and here's Tommy Ton in his front-row seat, right next to Anna Dello Russo, which seems sort of perfect—the style blogger and the stylebloglebrity, side by side in the new paradigm—and the first model appears in the distance, and the photographers in the pit come to life like one big whirring unindividuated insect life-form, the mandible gnashing of motor drive, and Scott Schuman sits far, far away.
