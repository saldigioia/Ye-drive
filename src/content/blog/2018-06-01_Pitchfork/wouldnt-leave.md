# “Wouldn’t Leave”

Since he lost his mother more than a decade ago, the fear of abandonment has emanated from Kanye West like a corrosive chemical. He expresses it in passing on “All Mine,” one of the ugliest songs on his new album ye, with the line “guarantee that bitch gonna leave you.” His dread is not subtle. But a minute later, “Wouldn’t Leave,” the centerpiece of the record, comes on and ye cracks open, shifting from darkness to light as Kanye bares his soul for us again. In doing so, he reminds us, as he has throughout his career, how he is like us, how we are like him.

“Wouldn’t Leave,” the thematic sequel to Yeezus’ coarse and loving “Bound 2,” is the sound of grace. Specifically, the grace Kanye experienced in the aftermath of one of his most unequivocally unforgivable public pronouncements, that slavery went on so long that it must have been a choice on the part of the slaves. “Wouldn’t Leave,” lifts the curtain on that hectic April day, taking us inside the hours after Kanye spoke to TMZ and heard from his wife. She was furious, according to the song and in his fear, in the moment, he just tried to preempt the inevitable: “Told her she could leave me now.”

Kanye speaks a lot of truth in his songs, but he’s also deeply unreliable, joking and dissembling and blustering with his lyrics. On “Wouldn’t Leave,” his verses are more defensive than they are sweet. But the music doesn’t lie, nor do the guests. The song opens with PartyNextDoor, who bellows “I don’t feel that she’s mine enough.” The insecurity arrives in block letters, hovering over the song like skywriting. The vulnerability is staggering. It’s just bass, keys, and crooning after that, and something snaps inside of you. The music is an army of prayer hands, floating on a wave—please and thank you and praise you all at once—all for Kim. Because even after he offers her that exit, he raps, “she wouldn't leave.”

So many of us have been there, and the song brings us right back. Abandonment can feel inevitable, and we’re so scared of it that we can bring it on ourselves. We say the dumbest things to the people we love most. Often we get what we deserve. The real friendship suffers. The good relationship ends. The things we don’t take enough care with are lost.

Kanye has to know that he doesn’t deserve Kim’s forgiveness, not rationally. But “Wouldn’t Leave” goes deeper than reason. It reminds us that sometimes, without rationale, we recover something that we thought we already lost. Sometimes when we least deserve it, we get another chance.
