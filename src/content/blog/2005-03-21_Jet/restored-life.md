# Restored Life 

Grammy Award-winning rapper-producer Kanye West and famed veteran artist Ernie Barnes attend an unveiling of a painting that Barnes did for West in Los Angeles. The painting, "A Life Restored," was commissioned by West to capture his near-death experience from a 2002 car accident that inspired such hits as his debut single, Through the Wire. "I felt and still feel that I have been given another chance to leave my mark on the world," West says. "I knew I had angels with me during my accident and I knew Ernie Barnes would reflect my experience as well as any artist could." The 9-foot-by-10-foot painting will be displayed on West's ceiling in his Los Angeles home. Barnes called the painting of angels a "celestial celebration of the moment when God said to Kanye, 'It's not your time.'" Barnes also wanted to convey the message "to use your God-given talents and squeeze your potential until it cries for mercy, just as Kanye has done since his accident." Barnes' career dates back to the 70s when his paintings were shown on TV's "Good Times." One of his most famous pieces was later showcased on the cover of Marvin Gaye's hit album, I Want You. His works have been collected by a long list of celebrities, including Harry Belafonte, Berry Gordy, Bill Cosby, Eddie Murphy, Will Smith, Sidney Poitier and Diana Ross.
