# Newfound Faith or Prosperity Gospel? The Superstar's Supershort Album Seems Slight.

A few moments into “Selah,” the second track from Kanye West’s new album, “Jesus Is King” (Def Jam/GOOD), he raps “Everybody wanted Yandhi / Then Jesus Christ did the laundry.” Those terse and slightly awkward lines explain how Mr. West, a hugely famous star known for his outsize ego and outrageous statements, came to make a collection of earnest gospel songs.

In September 2018, Mr. West announced “Yandhi,” which was to be his second solo release of the year. It had been a difficult stretch for Mr. West—he drew fire for remarks about slavery that his fans found offensive, refused to back down from his admiration for Donald Trump, and released “Ye,” widely considered to be his worst record. But “Yandhi” never materialized—it was delayed and, possibly, shelved, as Mr. West turned his attention to a project with a Christian theme.

In January, Mr. West and his wife, Kim Kardashian, began hosting weekly events they called “Sunday Service,” which offered a mix of gospel music, reworked versions of Mr. West’s own hits and new songs. They were said to express Mr. West’s spiritual transformation: “Now that I’m in service to Christ, my job is to spread the gospel, to let people know what Jesus has done for me,” he told DJ Zane Lowe in an interview recently.

Given the tumultuous state of his career, not everyone has taken Mr. West’s conversion at face value. The Sunday Services featured expensive merchandise for sale, such as a $50 pair of socks, so it’s reasonable to wonder if the events might be an attempt to turn the page on Mr. West’s difficult year and open up new markets. “Jesus Is King,” which hit streaming services on Friday after several delays, won’t do much to win over skeptics. More than anything, it seems slight. For all the intensity of Mr. West’s new focus, these 11 songs zip by in 27 minutes and only a handful of them leave a lasting impression.

Most of the songs on “Jesus Is King” are sketches in which a single musical idea is presented, looped and then cut off abruptly. Because the tracks don’t really develop, there’s very little space for drama, and Mr. West rarely makes you feel the power of the salvation he describes. Black gospel music is nothing new in Mr. West’s work—“Jesus Walks,” from his 2004 debut album, “The College Dropout,” prominently featured a sample of a choir, and the song addressed faith and doubt with an intensity that marked Mr. West as an artist to watch. But here, his spiritual life, instead of being one subject among many, is the entire point.

Given the album’s overriding theme and narrow focus, Mr. West’s groan-inducing lyrical asides, which have always been present in his work, stick out more than usual. On “Follow God,” he peppers his observations about trying to emulate Christ with quick hits about Instagram (“I was looking at the ‘Gram and I don’t even like likes”) and text messages. The next track, “Closed on Sunday,” builds on the theme: “Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A / Hold the selfies, put the ‘Gram away,” Mr. West raps, connecting the fast-food chain’s workweek policy with his own observance of the Sabbath. It doesn’t help that the song is sonically inert, with much of the music consisting of a simple beep.

In the days before the album’s release, word came that songs were still being mixed, and such last-minute tweaks have made parts of Mr. West’s work since 2016’s “The Life of Pablo” seem unfinished. “On God” is another clunker, built around a tightly sequenced synth riff and bass that feels lower in the mix than it should be. It finds him bragging that he’s the greatest artist of all time, which is typical for him, but on a gospel album where he frequently complains about not being taken seriously, it appears tone-deaf. “The IRS want they fifty plus our tithe,” he raps, before offering an unconvincing explanation for the high prices of the products he sells.

“Jesus Is King” has its moments. When massed voices come together to chant “Hallelujah” in “Selah,” it’s easy to set aside the questionable details surrounding this release and revel in the kind of musical power Mr. West used to routinely create. The spacey and lightly psychedelic “Water” is the best tune on the album, one of the few cuts with true development and a hint of mystery. “Use This Gospel,” which reunites the rap duo the Clipse and also features an instrumental break in its final section by smooth-jazz saxophonist Kenny G, has a certain “How did these people end up on the same song?” appeal.

So about half of “Jesus Is King” holds up, which means it has about 13 minutes of solid music. One day the album might take on new meaning, when it becomes connected to the broader arc of Mr. West’s life. In this moment, it’s neither good enough to stand on its own nor bad enough to be a fascinating disaster.
