# Kanye West Isn’t Joking Anymore

Early in this week’s BBC interview with Zane Lowe, Kanye West said, “I’ve been at it for 10 years.”

It’s true. Kanye made his mark as a solo artist exactly a decade ago, and through the trajectory of his career, you can trace the arc of cultural events big and small. Hurricane Katrina terrorizes New Orleans; Kanye responds with his infamous “George Bush doesn’t care about black people.” Taylor Swift does a million copies the first week of an album’s release twice in a row and becomes the biggest commercial artist of the 21st century — Kanye sets that into motion. Celebrity exploitation is perfected in the form of Kim Kardashian; Kanye dates and fathers a child with her.

The world has grown and changed, and so has Kanye. It’s been spellbinding. When we think about “watching an artist grow up,” we think too often of the child stars who physically mature before our eyes. We saw it happen with Michael Jackson. We’re seeing it happen right now with Miley Cyrus. But we forget that midlife is comprised of far more formative times, and that’s been shown pretty effectively through the Saga of Kanye West.

Kanye released “Through the Wire” in September 2003. He was 26. That album, The College Dropout, was so gripping because he had a fully-formed worldview by that point. That’s what coming into the spotlight at 26 gets you, as opposed to blowing up at 16. He had trauma like the near-fatal car crash he rapped about on “Through the Wire”, and a few real relationships under his belt already. It’s then crazy to think about how he developed as a musician and person from that point, combined with the effects of fame, success, scandal, public heartbreak, and personal tragedy, and it’s that purview that keeps him as the most captivating figure in contemporary art.

The musicians in The 27 Club have the shared thread of insanity, a small discography, and untapped potential. We saw Kanye West live past that. By the time his sophomore record, 2005’s Late Registration, arrived, Kanye was 28 and we were beginning to see his potential realized. In this week’s interview he said, “I know how to make perfect, but that’s not what I’m here to do.”

Kanye’s angst has had the time and room to expand. Now he’s a middle-aged man, and like Lester Burnham in American Beauty, he knows that the feeling of being “angry, insecure, confused” doesn’t necessarily go away. For the average 36-year-old, that torment is masked. A person who works in a corporate setting at 36 can be cracking, but go in everyday without a sign. The entire plot of American Beauty was centered around the fact that for once someone in that world was showing a sign; the drama came from the fact that it doesn’t happen that often. But in Kanye World, where his entire being is about production and expression, you will see the signs of a man fed up with life.

In the Zane Lowe interview, you hear him affirm this in reference to his latest album, Yeezus: “This is what frustration sounds like.” That frustration manifests in paparazzi freak outs, or in the Zane Lowe interview when he yells, “It’s been like that for a minute Hedi Slimane,” or on his Twitter text-screaming about Jimmy Kimmel yesterday, or in any classically Kanye moment, from the backstage tantrum at the 2007 VMAs, to Swiftgate, to the recently leaked audio of his reaction immediately following the Taylor Swift incident while in a restaurant with friends.

Is Kanye really that much crazier and fucked up than any of us? It’s easy and even safe to believe that he is, but have you never been at a table with friends venting about something that happened at work? Maybe you said something that was equal parts brilliant, arrogant, genius, and delusional, and the best you got out of it was a friend quoting you in a tweet. Kanye’s work is his music and his art and the culture he creates, except when he has a conversation about it, cameras are there, and literally millions of people are watching.

With that type of platform and base, naturally, opinions will vary. The people Kanye’s ranting to aren’t just a table of friends to coddle him. It’s a massive chunk of the population ready to criticize and disagree and object. Clearly, Kanye can’t handle that rejection, or more importantly, that misunderstanding.

You see it when he’s telling Zane Lowe about how Fendi rejected his designs and how no one will back his fashion line or any time he loses an award. People just know about how he lost it after losing Best New Artist to Gretchen Wilson at the 2004 American Music Awards or Best Video to Simian Mobile Disco at 2006 EMAs, but even in December of 2005 when the Grammy nominations were announced, he turned it in on himself: “If I don’t win album of the year I’m going to have a problem.”

Kanye doesn’t like being wrong or having his work dismissed as frivolous or having his intentions misinterpreted. That’s why this Kimmel situation spiraled out of control. There’s a legitimate concern that his truth isn’t breaking through. Kanye feels as if he gave the world “the most honest media in years” and the most visible conversation about it makes a mockery of him, aligns him with a whining child, and diminishes the most heartfelt segment of his expression.

Here you have Kanye pouring out emotions about his passions, his total obsession with product and design and how he wants to affect it and change things. Architecture. Clothing. WATER BOTTLE DESIGN. It’s all important to this man, and even with all the supporters in his corner, it still feels like no one gets it. It feels like no one gets it because Kanye has been painted as a delusional, sociopathic, egotistical maniac for his entire career, and for every dream realized, one is kept away because of those labels. For 10 years, he’s had to wear that badge and grow with it, and we’ve all gotten to witness it in a very public and detailed way that you get with very few people outside of yourself.

In the wake of the Kimmel rant, people are complaining that Kanye is devoid of humor these days. They’re totally right. This is the guy who made a “Throw Some Ds” remix about breast implants and made a parody video with John Mayer that went viral before things went viral. He can’t take a joke? He can’t realize that Jimmy Kimmel is probably a fan and is bigging him up by taking the time to make fun of him on such a big platform? He can’t get over himself enough to relax and realize it’s all fine?

In short, no. It’s not a joke anymore. When Ashton Kutcher tried to prank him on “Punk’d” years ago, we saw that he has no time for games when it involves his art. Kanye introduced a new pop culture generation to a certain kind of burning creative intensity, and his growth correlates with his constant wrestling with it.

The next 10 years of Kanye West, especially now that he has a daughter, will likely hold more incendiary moments. Imagine a 46-year-old Kanye West. It’s tough to decide if we want the midlife crisis to be over and for this dude to find peace and for him to figure it out or if we want the frustration and pain and flame to burn because it’s a sign of realness or a spectacle for our own amusement. The dynamic of that sick voyeurism shows why he’ll probably never be content (and neither will we), but it’s the source of energy that allows Kanye to thrive and exist. As he says, “My voice is only compressed to express myself artistically through music,” and may that never falter. Maybe you think he’s being too sensitive, but like he said in yesterday’s Twitter rant, put yourself in his shoes, and you’ll understand why.
