# The Tao of Kanye West

## The Star Raps With Us About His Literary Debut - And Hassling With Heartbreaks

The key to Kanye West's success? believe in your flyness, conquer your shyness - oh, and be leery of the free gift bag! That's just some of the wisdom the 12-time Grammy-winning rapper, 32, and his coauthor (and childhood pal), J. Sakiya Sandifer, dispense in their philosophy book, Thank You and You're Welcome. West shares with Us.

Q: What's your best advice for overcoming hard times?

Never complain without offering a solution. What's the point?

Q: Any tips on dating?

I don't think so. I could write a book on bad dating, though! How to Date the Wrong Way, by Kanye West! Here's how you can really [mess] up!

Q: What about style?

I get ridiculed for my love of it, but I just realize people are not accepting of true art.

Q: Are you really egotistical?

I get made to look like a megalomaniac, but other beliefs are arrogant because they don't give you a choice. I say, think for yourself.

Q: How did you feel when American Idol Kris Allen covered "Heartless"?

I penetrate pop culture. I write Broadway-level melodies that transcend any genre.

The 52-page tome is "things we practice in our own lives," Sandifer tells Us.

West (with girlfriend Amber Rose) tells Us he's not interested in acting.
