# Kanye West, Secc, Glasgow

The mainstreaming of hip-hop has led to a rapid migration of gigs from small clubs to arenas such as the SECC. As a result, many of them have forfeited their heritage of being participation-based events to become lucrative spectator ones. It’s a problem Kanye West is aware of: at last week’s Brits, he filled the stage with G- stringed women sprayed gold. This evening, we are presented with an altogether different proposition: a clothed string section. Including a harp.

“Nobody else in the game will give you this, “ he promises, adding that other acts often just have an empty stage with “five niggas going . . . we got a string section here!”, seemingly as surprised as everyone else. It’s used to dramatic effect during Diamonds (from Sierra Leone), which samples Shirley Bassey’s Diamonds Are Forever, but more subtle contributions are often upstaged by the immediacy of West’s production style: big samples, vocal hooks and melodies.

Another note of sophistication is West’s decision to opt for political visuals rather than the outbursts for which he is known. During We Don’t Care, there are images of Malcolm X marches and, on Spaceship, about working in McJobs, a reversed GAP logo is projected onscreen. Cleverly, the end of The NewWorkout Plan, which satirises the belief of some women that the answer to their problems is several weeks in the gym and nothing to eat, is mixed by DJ A- Trak into Eurythmics, Sweet Dreams (Are Made of These). The highlight among all these high points was Gold Digger, which West could have performed prostrate and it’d still have eclipsed all else. West knows he’s pulled it off. “Are y’all not entertained?” asks the new bard.
