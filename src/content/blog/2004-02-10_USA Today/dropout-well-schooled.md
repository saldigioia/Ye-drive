# ‘Dropout': Well Schooled

Despite all the beats Kanye West has generated in recent months — Twista’s Slow Jamz, Alicia Keys’ You Don’t Know My Name and Ludacris’ Stand Up among them — it seems he has been hoarding the best ones for himself. And after years of trying to convince industry suits that he could rap as well as produce, it turns out he has plenty to say. Lead single Through the Wire, made while his jaw was wired shut as he was recovering from a near-fatal accident, finds him flashing back on his life. On All Falls Down, he pointedly deals with his weakness for material things, while Jesus Walks is a plea for spiritual guidance in the face of societal and industry forces. Not everything is that deep: Get ‘Em High and Breathe In and Breathe Out describe various sexcapades, and School Spirit presents a sarcastic view of the college experience. Throughout, the music is typically soulful and quirky, and with the help of such past collaborators as Twista, Jay-Z, Talib Kweli, Common and Ludacris, this dropout goes to the head of the class.
