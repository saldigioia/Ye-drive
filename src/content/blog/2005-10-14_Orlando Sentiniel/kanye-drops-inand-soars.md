# Kanye Drops In...and Soars

## The Hip-Hop Star and His Band Focus on Music With Striking Results.

TAMPA — Kanye West’s reputation as one of rap’s uplifting figures suffered a dent when he ranted about the president in a televised Katrina benefit, but his spirit soared again on Wednesday at the University of South Florida’s Sun Dome.

West’s energetic 90-minute performance, exceedingly generous by hip-hop standards, was a tastefully produced, musically inventive display that showed that this producer-turned-superstar deserves all the attention garnered by his hit albums The College Dropout and Late Registration.

West’s specialty isn’t tired boasting about bling or overt violence that powers so many stars on MTV. On Wednesday, his songs about life’s joys and problems were accompanied by images of doves or roses, something one doesn’t see from Ludacris or 50 Cent.

Nor did West spit any more venom at President Bush, although some in the crowd obviously would have supported the idea. One fan was dressed in a dark suit jacket with the words “Bush hates me, too” painted on the back. West’s only reference to the aftermath of the devastating Gulf storms was positive:

“My heart goes out to the victims of Katrina and Rita, all the soldiers at war and everybody out on the streets.”

It’s called the “Touch the Sky” tour, so it was appropriate that West opened the show with that splashy song off Late Registration. Dressed in a slick off-white suit, West prowled the stage with energy as his impressive band delivered the song with studio precision.

The band members stood in shadowy silhouette behind four large scrims at the rear of the stage, an ensemble that featured a string section (including harp), percussionist, DJ and keyboardist. Musically, Late Registration is ambitious in scope, and the musicians did a remarkable job of reproducing it. “Heard ‘Em Say,” in particular, was elevated by its live arrangement.

Not everything was so inspired, though. The 20 minutes by opening act Keyshia Cole were a mess. Her singing was strong, and she seemed to be doing it herself, but the prerecorded backing tracks veered from too harshly loud to too ridiculously quiet.

Once, the music started blaring when she was still introducing the song. Also odd: Her two backing singer/dancers often just sat on a riser and did nothing.

Cole was followed by American Idol Fantasia Barrino, who was charismatic in a 35-minute set accompanied by a four-piece band and three back-up singers. Fantasia, who might one day deserve the one- name Cher treatment, demonstrated her powerful voice on “Free Yourself,” “It’s All Good” and more tasty R&B. She closed with Aerosmith’s “Dream On,” telling the crowd: “You can be whatever you wanna be.”

West exudes the same kind of optimism, although he ought to save the rousing “Jesus Walks” for the closing number instead of following it with 15 minutes of less-fiery material that had some folks heading for the exits. Otherwise, it’s easy to understand why he’s so hot.
