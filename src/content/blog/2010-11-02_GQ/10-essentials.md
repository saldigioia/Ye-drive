## The Rapper, Producer, and Designer Names the Things He Won't Do Without

After making his name as a producer, West released his debut album in 2004 and quickly became one of the world's top recording artists. He's also a widely read blogger and a regular at the men's and women's collections. He has designed footwear for Nike and Louis Vuitton and has twice been named to Vanity Fair's best-dressed list.

### 1. Heather-Gray Balmain T-Shirt

“This is the most important thing on this list. It's the perfect tee, it goes with everything, and it's a slightly heavier weight."

### 2. Black Air Yeezys

"When I was designing these, I was inspired by the combinations of the materials used on Fendi Spy bags, as well as the colorways used on the robots in Robotech—muted tones accented with a pop of color. And of course we referenced the Nike Mag from Back to the Future II. We're trying to bring kids into the future with this shoe."

### 3. Dark-Brown RRL Jeans in Slim Boot Cut

"When I travel the world, I study how people dress in real life. Most men dress utilitarian—it's for a purpose. Contrary to hip-hop belief, baggy jeans are actually a fashion statement, while fitted jeans are the more classic option."

### 4. iPod Nano, iPhone, Macbook Air With Aircard

"I've got my Nano that I jog with, and an iPhone that I take pictures with. I love how light the Macbook is, and I'm always online. But I didn't connect the internet to my Blackberry on purpose. I don't want to be bothered like that."

### 5. Vintage Levi's Jean Jacket

"What's good about a jean jacket? What's not good about a jean jacket? I have like five of 'em. It's cool beacuse I used it as a layering piece, or as my main jacket. I can put it under a peacoat, I can put it over a T-shirt. It adds a classic-ness and roughness to an outfit."

### 6. Blacked-Out Rolex Submariner

"Me and a couple of my boys had this dinner conversation of what we thought the top brands were, and then made a decision to purchase those brands. So for watches, it's Rolex. This company called Black-Out Concept actually painted the Rolex black. It looks hard—it looks really cool. It's a new take on a classic watch."

### 7. Calvin Klein Bor Briefs

"I like bor briefs with suits because they don't bunch up."

### 8. Lanvin Seersucker Dinner Jacket

"I could wear it in Hawaii with a T-shirt, I could wear it in New York with a dress shirt. It embodies everything I like to be and do in fashion, riding the line between luxury and casual. It speaks volumes."

### 9. Louis Vuitton Monogramouflauge Keepall

"It's just the best duffel bag ever. To actually have it be the Louis monogram in camoflauge? That works internationally. No matter where you go, that gets respect. A five-year-old could see this bag and think it's cool."

### 10. Retro Super Future Flat-Top Sunglasses

"They're made in Italy, slightly bigger size than the normal Wayfarer. Whenever I wear stuff that's true to where it was when it came out—thirty, forty years ago, or whatever—it'll feel more costumey to me than modern. These, on the other hand, are classic but current."
