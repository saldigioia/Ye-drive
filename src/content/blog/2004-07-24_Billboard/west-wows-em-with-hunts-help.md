# West Wows 'Em With Hunt's Help

The touring world has a strong new hip-hop attraction on its hands in Kanye West, at least if appearances at two recent Southern concert series are any indication.

The Def Jam artist played Atlanta’s Aquafina on the Bricks at Centennial Olympic Park on July 9, then Nashville’s Bridge- a stone in the District at Riverfront Park the next night. Both series are produced by Nashville-based promoter MAD Booking & Events, which charges $5 for tickets.

Rising Capitol artist Van Hunt, an Atlanta native, opened both shows, which helped On the Bricks draw 35,000 people. Bridge-stone drew 10,000, and both nights were among the two events’ most successful.

“It was insane,” says MAD president Marcie Alien Cardwell, who admits she knew Atlanta would be big because of Hunt. “There is such a buzz on him that we were prepared.”

Cardwell says the audience was primarily African-American in Atlanta, while in Nashville, the audience was an equal split between African-American and white fans.

“I was so excited in Nashville because it was such a diverse group of people, and you don’t see that a lot [in Nashville],” she says. “Both nights had not one [negative] incident.”

Cardwell and others believe the Nashville show was a defining musical moment in Music City.

“It was so cool to look out into that audience and see blacks, whites, Hispanics, and so many families,” she says. “It was one of those shows that makes you realize why you do this.”

In Nashville, MAD offered a buy-one-get-one-free promotion for attendees who brought a toy for the city’s Martha O’Brien Center, a nonprofit resource center for inner-city families. The promo was so successful that Cardwell says she’ll continue to offer it for the rest of the summer.

Jeff Frasco at Creative Artists Agency now books West, but when Cardwell booked the artist, he was handled by Cara Lewis at William Morris Agency.

“Cara and William Morris really took care of me this summer,” Cardwell says, adding that she also booked dates on such acts as Out-Kast’s Big Boi, Cypress Hill, Nina Sky, and Chingy. Cardwell says Chingy drew about 10,000 to Aquafina on the Bricks.
