# It's All About Kanye

A smorgasbord of self-love, a hip-hop huzzah for the hottest rapper-producer in the game, Kanye West’s show at the USF Sun Dome on Wednesday was a gonzo celebration of all things Kanye, the “Louis Vuitton Don” who’s boldly inventive enough to put a turntablist and a string section onstage.

The Chicago-born ‘Ye is a different dude to be sure. On his two groundbreaking albums, 2004’s Grammy-winning The College Dropout and the new Late Registration, West has foregone rap braggodocio about guns and ammo and has instead used soul, funk and R&B influences to illuminate his two favorite topics: (1) the everyday life of the black working class and (2) himself.

He’s a charming egotist to be sure, and his current struggle between staying real and staying rich has been fun to witness. West is also as controversial as they come: When he uttered “George Bush doesn’t care about black people” on a nationally televised Hurricane Katrina benefit last month, he became a household name - for better or worse.

West didn’t do any overt prez-bashing at his area gig, which was only the second stop on a world tour, but don’t go thinking he’s added subtlety to his act. This guy is about as low-key as Carrot Top.

Backed by two singers, a percussionist, a mad-scratching DJ, a keyboard player and a seven-piece all-female string section that looked like something out of a Robert Palmer video, West sprinted onstage to the orchestral-gangsta glory of new song Touch the Sky. He then meshed Queen’s We Will Rock You into 2004’s We Don’t Care. And before anyone could catch their breath, he girded saucy exercise spoof New Workout Plan with a conga-line beat and a coda of the Eurthymics’ Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This).

(Let it be known that West kept his backing band in white mesh cages. Can’t have anyone stealing limelight from the main man, dontcha know.)

For more than 90 minutes, West kept the same track-meet pace, pounding the 3,572 fans with all manner of sensory overload. He rolled out a white bed for saucy ballad Late; he rolled out a rack of Gap clothes for 9-to-5er lament Spaceship; he rolled out a gurney for a tribute to his grandmother, Roses.

As a rapper, West isn’t as limber-lipped as Twista or as smooth as Jay-Z. But he’s funny and likable, and his chummy, slightly clunky rhyming only makes people dig him more. (However, he could have done without having some of his pals grab a mike and join him for a stretch.)

West’s epic-minded production skills are what really set him apart from most of his rap peers. On the unabashedly sweet Hey Mama, the tribute to his mother featured a ‘60s-style “la la la” hook straight out of Haight-Ashbury. For current smash Gold Digger, in which West attempted to prove how tough it is dating extremely attractive women, he incorporated a stuttery sample of Ray Charles’ I Got a Woman. And Jesus Walks, an incendiary confessional about loving the Lord but digging sin too, was enriched with a thunderous gospel chorus.

He loves Jesus. He loves his mom. He loves his fans.

Now I ask you: How can you hate a guy like that?

It’s hard to open a show for a man-in-demand such as Kanye, who at one point even ran an impromptu lap through the crowd, sending his fans into flailing fits. But last year’s American Idol winner, Fantasia (her last name, Barrino, has been dropped per the strictures of divadom), proved that she can hold her own wherever she goes.

Making a yowza bid for title of the Next Tina Turner, the North Carolina native let holler with several tent-revival gems, including smoldering covers of Aerosmith’s Dream On and Prince’s Purple Rain.

(Although when she called that last song “an old one,” my back immediately went out on me.)

Rapper Commmon, whose new album was produced by West, was originally scheduled to perform as well, but he has reportedly left the tour in order to shoot a movie.

Note to Common: You missed a good one, Hollywood.
