# “The Joy”

Lots of history here, tributes inside tributes. There's the sample of Curtis Mayfield's "The Makings of You" (the last time Kanye and Curtis hooked up, it was for "Touch the Sky", which slowed down "Move on Up".) There's Bronx-born producer Pete Rock, who helped birth the soul-sample-heavy style Kanye took global this century. (On the 2004 Slum Village track "Selfish", Kanye purported to be "the new version of Pete Rock.") There's Jay-Z, who recently scoffed, "niggas want my old shit, buy my old album" on "On to the Next One". ("The Joy" could comfortably reside on the Kanye-aided, Pete Rock-indebted The Blueprint-- which happens to be one of Jay-Z's old albums.) Naturally, Kanye isn't immune to the contradictions either-- "no electro, no metro, a little retro, ah perfecto" sounds a little revisionist from the guy who sampled Daft Punk, made "Flashing Lights" a hit, and sports tailored suits in bed.

But once you hear what Rock does with Mayfield, such hypocritical back-peddling slides under easy just because the lineage is so pure. Kanye and Jay may have moved on musically, but there's no one else that can do soul-sampling hip-hop like Jay and Kanye. "The Joy" is a unique throwback. It flattens time, flows endless.
