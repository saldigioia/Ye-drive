# West Takes Time for Third Apology

LOS ANGELES — Kanye West used Jay Leno’s prime-time debut Monday to offer another apology for ruining Taylor Swift’s night at the MTV Video Music Awards and to say he’s going to take some time off for reflection. West said he knew he was wrong the moment he handed the microphone back to Swift, when he was bathed in boos. He had interrupted Swift on Sunday night as she accepted a best female video award for “You Belong With Me,” arguing that Beyonce’s “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)” was more deserving.

“It was rude, period,” West said. He posted a second apology to Swift on his blog on Monday, and told Leno he wanted to apologize to the country music star in person.

West took a long pause when Leno asked what his mother would have said about the incident. West was very close to his mother, Donda, who died in November 2007. He said yes when Leno asked whether his moth- er would have given him a lecture.

“So many celebrities, they never take the time off,” he said. “I’ve never taken the time off to really - you know, just music after music and tour after tour. I’m just ashamed that my hurt caused someone else’s hurt. My dream of what awards shows are supposed to be, ‘cause, and I don’t try to justify it because I was just in the wrong. That’s period. But I need to, after this, take some time off and just analyze how I’m going to make it through the rest of this life, how I’m going to improve.”
