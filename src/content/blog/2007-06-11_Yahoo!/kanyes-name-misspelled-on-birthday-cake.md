# Kanye's Name Misspelled on Birthday Cake

Kanye West's 30th birthday celebrations were marred when he was given a cake misspelling his name, according to reports.

The rap superstar was the center of attention at a lavish party in New York over the weekend, with Usher, Mariah Carey, Puff Daddy, Jay-Z, and Rihanna among the guests.

The evening took place at the Louis Vuitton mansion and Tenjune nightclub in New York, where he was apparently presented with the cake emblazoned with the word "Kayne."

Meanwhile, the party apparently included live performances from John Legend and Pharrell Williams.

Speaking about the anniversary, Kanye commented: "I'm in my twenties as we speak right now, but at midnight, I'll be 30. I'm already 30 in Japan and London and everywhere else."

Kanye West is due to release his new album, Graduation, in August.
