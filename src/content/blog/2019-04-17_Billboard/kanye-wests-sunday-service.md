# Kanye West’s Sunday Service

Kanye West brought his now famed Sunday Service, which he started in January, to Coachella’s second weekend for a special Easter celebration. The service took place atop a hill built for the occasion within a Coachella campsite, and featured guest appearances from Chance the Rapper, Teyana Taylor and DMX. During the two-hour event, West debuted a fittingly spiritual new song, “Water.” He also took part in renditions of some of his classics, like “All Falls Down” and “Jesus Walks,” along with covers of Stevie Wonder’s “As” and Soul II Soul’s “Back to Life.” Chance joined him for a choir-driven take on “Ultralight Beam,” and DMX delivered an emotional prayer that brought West to tears. Attendees included Katy Perry and fiance Orlando Bloom, Childish Gambino, Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott, as well as West’s wife, Kim Kardashian, and daughter North. Chicken and waffles and vegan breakfast burritos were available ahead of the service, and once gates opened, fans rushed to a merchandise tent to purchase everything from $50 “church socks” to $225 sweatshirts emblazoned with slogans like “Holy Spirit” and “Trust God.” After more than two years of erratic behavior, Kanye fandom has become increasingly untenable for many. Though far from perfect, West’s service showed there might be some light at the end of his tunnel. The livestream of the performance was shown through a small circular lens, literalizing that very idea.
