# College Dropout

There have been few hip-hop debuts as mature and polished as producer-rapper Kanye West’s “College Dropout.”

As a lyricist, he has the courage to reach beyond mainstream rap’s dominant themes -- in addition to women and partying, West discusses religion, social change and the importance of family. As a beat maker, he finds ways to continually reinvent his much-copied trademark production style (looping sped-up old soul samples).

But it is West’s focus on melody that sets “Dropout” apart. On songs such as “Jesus Walks” and “Family Business,” he rips down the barrier separating gospel and popular R&B from hip-hop, instead building his own style from scratch by rapping over a combination of samples, choirs and other subtle background vocals.

The result is incredibly catchy, accessible and melodic hip-hop, delivered by an artist whose admitted arrogance is matched by the talent of his guest list, including fellow Chicagoan Common and Talib Kweli on the excellent, straightforward “Get Em High.” Twista and Jamie Foxx star on a slightly revamped version of the radio hit “Slow Jamz.” Also appearing are Mos Def, Ludacris and Jay-Z, who seems to abandon retirement plans on “Never Let Me Down” by rapping: “Number one albums, what I got like four of them? More of them on the way.”

West himself lacks the vocal presence of his guests and sometimes stumbles over awkward rhymes, but makes up for it with expansive subject matter and a stylized, sing-song delivery that he carefully matches to the beats, especially on the dancy “The New Workout Plan” and hit true-life car-crash survivor tale “Through The Wire.”

Skits mar the album. Though several poking fun at the economics of higher learning are hilarious, they disrupt the continuity and show the dark side of West’s arrogance.

However, the 26-year-old delivers musical talent and a sense of maturity that mainstream hip-hop has lacked recently, and this outstanding debut must not be missed.
