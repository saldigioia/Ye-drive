# West Frontier

As if The Roc’s chief executive officer, Damon Dash, isn’t busy enough with movies, music and his fashion companies, he said he is launching a clothing line for Roc-A-Fella Records artist Kanye West. “We are working on it now,” Dash said from the set of his film, *State Property II*. “It will be men’s to start with and we will take it from there.” West’s debut album, “The College Dropout,” has been sitting on top of Billboard’s Top 20 R&B/Hip-Hop chart since its launch seven weeks ago.
