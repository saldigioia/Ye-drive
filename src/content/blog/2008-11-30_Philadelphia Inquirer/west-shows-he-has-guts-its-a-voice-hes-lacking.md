# West Shows He Has Guts; It’s a Voice He’s Lacking

Brave is the word you’ll hear, if you haven’t already, in reference to Kanye West’s new album, 808s & Heartbreak.

The rapper-producer’s fourth studio album, which has already been declared “great art” by no less an authority than West himself, is brave, much like a glamorous Hollywood actor packing on the pounds and getting down and dirty for a seriously unpretty role. (And in hopes of an Oscar.)

It’s brave in the tradition of radical departures such as David Bowie’s 1977 Low or Neil Young’s 1982 Trans, in that it represents a major artist’s risking alienation of his core audience by refusing to deliver what they loved about him in the first place.

How radical a departure is it? It’s been hyped as an album filled with West singing, not rapping. That overstates the case: Many of West’s navel-gazing ruminations on these 11 songs are a mix of straight-up rapping and poor vocalizing.

The fascinating failure that is 808s & Heartbreak (Roc-A-Fella * * 1/2) is seriously short on two things.

Though it takes its name from the Roland TR-808 drum machine that generates beats, the album is missing the kind of samples that have juiced West’s self-obsessed hip-pop jams in the past, such as the Steely Dan loop that powered “Champion” on last year’s Graduation or Ray Charles’ “I Got A Woman” that fired up “Gold Digger” on 2005’s Late Registration.

The second missing ingredient is fun. That’s by design. 808s & Heartbreak is West’s first album since he split with fiancee Alexis Phifer this year, and since the death last November of his mother, Donda, which is the subject of the chilling “The Coldest Winter.”

The party’s-over approach is exquisitely, if accidentally, timed: 808s is an antimaterialist, down-and-out salvo released in the economic winter of our discontent.

808s means to be a classic breakup album, like Bob Dylan’s Blood on the Tracks, Marvin Gaye’s Here, My Dear, or Beck’s Sea Change. To fit the mood, the arrangements make a show of being stripped of any potentially joyous elements. When I was listening in my iTunes player, the final cut, the spooky “Pinocchio Story,” recorded live in Singapore, segued into West’s ebullient 2005 hit “Hey Mama,” and the contrast couldn’t have been starker.

Besides a few guest raps (Young Jeezy on “Amazing,” Lil Wayne on “See You in My Nightmares”), each song is typically built from only the sound of the drum machine and West’s voice. But his voice is filtered through the pitch-altering Auto-Tune device that the producer T-Pain has made the most ubiquitous gimmick in contemporary R&B.

While 808s may be risky, even foolhardy, West is no fool. He’s an artist who puts studio trickery to work in service of his emotional intentions. So he uses Auto-Tune to create a sense of isolation — from his audience, from those he loves (or used to), and from himself.

Sometimes the approach pays off, big-time. In the single “Love Lockdown,” pounding drum sounds and a minimalist keyboard figure create a claustrophobic mood, and West’s voice splinters into pieces, echoing his personal disintegration.

And for all of 808s’ severity — like Bruce Springsteen’s Nebraska, it feels like a collection of song demos that the artist chose to release unadorned — West’s excellence as a craftsman ensures that the songs’ hooks assert themselves, even on bummers as serious as “Bad News.”

There are a couple of roadblocks, however, in getting to the emotional catharsis West is seeking. For starters, as a vocalist, he’s unable to express the feelings that he clearly feels so intensely. 808s is soul music sung by somebody who’s still learning to sing.

And then there’s the matter of West’s oft-discussed ego. Breakup albums are expected to wallow in hurt, and point a finger at the ex in question. But West’s capacity for self-pity knows no bounds. We can kind of, sort of feel his pain on “Welcome to Heartbreak” when, feeling old at 31, he sings, “Chased the good life, all my life long / Looking back at my life, all my life gone / Where did I go wrong?”

In the same song, though, he crosses the line by asking us to feel sorry for him because while his pals have been raising families, all he’s been doing is accumulating residences. “My friend showed me pictures of his kids / And all I could show him were pictures of my cribs.”

The indulgence and desperation that makes 808s so maddening — and often compelling — peaks on “Pinocchio Story.” On the spare, ghostly track, the Louis Vuitton Don is gobsmacked by the realization that material things will not bring him happiness.

“There is no YSL they could sell to get my heart out of this hell,” he raps.

We’re free to scoff at West’s naivete. But he still succeeds, however awkwardly, in making his anguish felt. “What does it feel like, I ask you tonight, to live a real life?” the would-be Pinocchio asks his chattering audience, which doesn’t seem to be paying attention.

Undaunted, he goes on. “It’s like I’m looking for something out there, trying to find something,” but for all his earnest searching, “I turn on the TV, and see me, and see nothing.”

As always with West, 808s & Heartbreak is a long look in the mirror. But this time all he sees is the emptiness inside.
