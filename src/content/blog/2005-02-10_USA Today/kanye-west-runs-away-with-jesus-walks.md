# Kanye West Runs Away With 'Jesus Walks' 

Three years ago, when Kanye West was trying to get a record deal, the then-rising producer was told that Jesus Walks would never get any radio play.

It turned out to be the biggest hit from his College Dropout debut. The rapper, 27, will perform it Sunday at the 47th Grammy Awards in L.A. with his R&B protege John Legend and gospel titans Mavis Staples and the Blind Boys of Alabama.

West has the most nominations with 10, including two for Jesus Walks: song and rap song. The frustrations he encountered trying to sell the song show up in its second verse: “ . . . So here go my single, dog, radio needs this/They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus/That means guns, sex, lies, videotapes/But if I talk about God, my record won’t get played, huh?”

“It was never a problem once it came out,” says West, who has produced hits for the likes of Jay-Z, Alicia Keys, Janet Jackson and Ludacris. “All I did was use reverse psychology. It was a way of calling out people who didn’t want to play it without pointing fingers at anybody.”

West says he knew all along that he would prove naysayers wrong with his album, which sold 2.5 million copies. He went against the gangster grain and dealt more with human frailties. What he didn’t expect was all the accolades.

“I thought that people would like it a lot, and the songs would blow up, and people would buy the album,” says West, who also drew praise for his performances last summer on Usher’s Truth Tour. “But the Grammy nominations were just overwhelming. I remember as a little kid dreaming that I would get a chance to be at the Grammys. I never thought I would get 10 (nominations). I would have been happy with just one. The Grammys really open up doors. It makes you official.”

College Dropout already has won other awards, and he even got attention for one where he didn’t win. The gospel Stellar Awards, influenced by the success of Jesus Walks, initially had the album on its ballot for rap/hip-hop CD of the year, but later removed it because of explicit language.

“By the time I found out about it, they had already taken it away,” West says. “But the fact they recognized it in the first place means that it had its impact. The message that God wanted me to deliver was made, and the people that it was supposed to help, it helped.”

West won’t be resting on his laurels. He is finishing his follow- up album, Late Registration, which he hopes to have out in late March or April.
