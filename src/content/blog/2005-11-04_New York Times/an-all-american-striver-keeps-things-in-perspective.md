# An All-American Striver Keeps Things in Perspective

Upward mobility is everything to Kanye West. On Wednesday night at the Theater at Madison Square Garden, his set began with the sound of Curtis Mayfield’s “Move On Up,” and in his raps he presented himself as an all-American striver: close to his family, ambitious, hard-working, initially unappreciated, faced with setbacks (including a serious automobile accident) but eventually reaping huge rewards.

He can’t resist flaunting them. But he’s self-conscious when he does, wondering if the urge to acquire diamonds and fancy cars means that he has been seduced by a racist system. “We buy our way out of jail,” he rapped in his hit single “All Falls Down,” and the audience supplied the follow-up: “But we can’t buy freedom.”

Mr. West is a pop rarity: a producer who can also perform. His ear for samples, particularly from lush 1970’s soul songs, and his skill at building drama into backing tracks created hits for a long list of hip-hop and R&B performers. But as his songs tell it, no one wanted to hear his own raps. Two Top 10 albums later, that has changed.

Onstage, live musicians — including a string section and a harp, silhouetted behind a scrim — reinforced the orchestral soul samples while Mr. West darted around the stage. His wardrobe underscored his story: first a dapper jacket and flashy sunglasses to announce who he is, then a fast-food worker’s uniform shirt and name tag for his underdog years, later a white suit when he moved toward preacherlike testimony in “Jesus Walks.” Mr. West delivers his rhymes in an unassuming, conversational tone, but they’re fast and precise, and onstage it was clear that his producer’s ear extends to his vocals: in each song, his voice was placed at a different, unswerving pitch.

Mr. West is as important for what’s not in his raps — thuggery and violence — as for what is. He articulates sympathy for the black community in songs like “Crack Music,” which details the alchemy of ghetto misery into mass culture. He mixes self-satisfaction and joshing complaints about his own status as a hitmaker and star, while admitting to his failings in songs like “Addiction.” And whenever it seems that he might turn too goody-goody, Mr. West flashes a sense of humor.

On Wednesday night, he didn’t talk about politics as he did during the Hurricane Katrina telethon in September, when he said “George Bush doesn’t care about black people.” But he did insert Mr. Bush’s name into the lyrics of “All Falls Down” as a drug profiteer.

Mr. West had the perfect apex for his story arc: “Gold Digger,” a lighthearted warning about feminine wiles that reaches back to an old Ray Charles song. It’s currently the No. 1 single: just where upward mobility leads.

Sharing the bill were two R&B singers: Keyshia Cole, whose husky voice reaches back to Southern soul, and Fantasia, the “American Idol” winner. Fantasia’s voice has a distinctive bite, and her clipped phrasing jabs at emotional peaks. But she started at fever pitch and stayed there until it grew wearing.
