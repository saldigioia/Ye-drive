## The Vows of the Year Are Here! Us Unveils the Secret Plans

Five days before the wedding of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, a slew of crates marked confections were hauled into the Forte di Belvedere in Florence, Italy. Cranes began erecting marquee tents. And workers scuttled around, reading instructions off iPads. Seven hundred miles away in Paris, the bride, 33, and groom, 36, were receiving other key parts of their dream day: Kardashian's mom, Kris Jenner, and siblings Rob and Kourtney, none of whom knew quite what to expect from the three-day, twocountry extravaganza. "It will be a princess fairy tale for Kim," reveals a West source. "Kanye thought of every detail." Us has the minute-by-minute itinerary!

### FRIDAY: Rehearsal in Paris

Let the games begin! Urged to touch down in Paris by the morning of May 23, the couple's roughly 120 guests - including Jay Z and Beyoncé, and John Legend and Chrissy Teigen - will check in to the Four Seasons Hotel George V, where a secret welcome gift awaits. (Suites start at $2,012 a night, and guests foot their own bills.) "At exactly 3 p.m.," says a source close to the parents of 11-month-old North, "attendees will get a text saying what's happening the rest of the weekend."

First up: a 5 p.m. departure - dress in vintage French royaltythemed attire, s'il votis plait - for a celebration at the Palace of Versailles, once home to Marie Antoinette. Catherine Pegard, president of the gilded château, tells Us, "Kim and Kanye have decided to visit with their guests for a private surprise tour on the eve of their marriage."

### SATURDAY: I Do's in Italy

©Aurevoir, France. At 10:30 a.m., guests will convene at the hotel, carry-on and black-tie garb in hand, awaiting chariots to an airfield. "They were told to bring only a small amount," says a source. Alisters and commoners (like West's photographer father, Ray) will mingle on a chartered jet bound for Florence. "There's no first-class seating," says a source. "That should be interesting!"

Shuttles will whisk the group to hotels, including the Four Seasons and Hotel Savoy, where, according to an email sent by planners, "private rooms will be available to change and freshen up." Like mice in a Cinderella moment, an army of hair and makeup pros will be on hand for two hours of preceremony primping. "All the women are competing," designer Michael Costello, who created custom gowns for Kim's friends Brittny Gastineau and Larsa Pippen, tells Us. "They want to show up and shut it down." Italian designer Ermanno Scervino made looks for the mother of the bride and Kim's sisters Kylie Jenner and Khloé, says a source.

Kim will finally unveil her gown (did she settle on Azzedine Alai'a? Balmain?) during her march down the aisle at the Forte di Belvedere, Marco Agnoletti, a spokesman for the Florence City Council, confirms to Us. An insider at the 16th-century fortress - which cost more than $400,000 to rent - says to expect sunset vows precisely at 6 p.m.

Amid sculptures by Vanessa Beecroft, a West tour collaborator known for performance art involving nude models, revelers will toast Mr. and Mrs. West with "a special menu," says an insider, from three-star Michelin-rated Enoteca Pinchiorri's chef Giorgio Pinchiorri. His signature dish: olive-crusted lobster with corn purée and crustacean stew.

### Guest Guidelines:

What the groom says, goes! Teigen, Legend (right) and other invitees received orders.

- **Cede Control to Kanye:** A source says, "Nobody, not even Kim's sisters, knows the plan."

- **Dress to Impress:** Designer Costello tells Us clients were clear: "I feel like Kim has given the girls some direction because they had specifics of what they were looking for, like lace detailing and black or red. The mermaid silhouette takes place in a lot of the dresses we're doing."

* **Check Cells:** Phones won't be allowed at the vows. Neither will Keeping Up With the Kardashians cameras, says a source, who adds that prep will air.

### SUNDAY: The Final Fete

As the newlyweds bask in the morning-after glow, Legend and Teigen will make a hasty exit from their hotel. "They have to fly out of Florence early for an event in Atlantic City," says a source. Guests not granted an exception were instructed "not to book flights out of Paris until 4:30 p.m. Sunday," says the insider. Before heading back to the City of Light, they will get one last taste of Florence: a brunch, likely held at the Corsini Villa a Castello, 6 miles south of the fortress. Purchased by the Medicis in the 17th century, the estate boasts an Italian art collection more than 1,000 years old. That rich history, West recently told newspaper La Nazione, influenced the destination. "I think that our daughter, North, was conceived [in Florence] among the Renaissance masterpieces," he said. "It is one of the most beautiful cities in the world - for me, the most beautiful in Europe."

Once back in Paris, guests needn't worry about missing connections. "Everything's been taken care of," says a Kim source. "The wedding planners are very hands-on. It seems like there could even be one coordinator for every five guests!"

North will stay with her parents one more day before flying to L.A. with Kris, affectionately known as "Lovey" instead of Grandma. But Kim won't jet off to a honeymoon. After an appearance at the Cannes film festival, Kim will join her husband at the Prague union of his stylist, Renelou Padora. A wedding in just one country? How old-fashioned!

"Guests are freaking out about there being a destination wedding on top of a destination wedding. It's crazy!"

### A Source Tells Us:

When she landed in Paris May 18, Kim toted only one precious piece of cargo: daughter North. West insists that his bride-to-be let others do the heavy lifting. "Since Kim began dating Kanye, she travels like he does. An assistant takes luggage ahead," says a source close to the pair. "When they arrive at their hotel, everything is unpacked, steamed and ready to go." No job is too small, adds the insider: "North's baby clothes, formula and diapers are all taken in advance too!"
