# Kanye West

## For the Superstar Rapper Turned Student of Style, Fashion Rocks as Much as Music.

At 31, the Atlanta-born, Chicago-bred Kanye Omari West is one of the most talented music entertainers of our time. West, whose first name means the only one in Swahili, has earned piles of accolades including a dozen Grammy Awards for his lyric prowess, but it is his sartorial savvy that is now going platinum. He was a front-row fixture at the fall collections about 20 shows in all, including Narciso Rodriguez and Preen in New York, House of Holland and Richard Nicoll in London, and YSL and Stella McCartney in Paris. Having developed a capsule jewelry collection with Takashi Murakami, he’s now designing a line of boldly colored trainers for Louis Vuitton (available next month), in addition to creations for his own clothing label, Pastelle. Lately he’s been feeling red: a Martin Margiela sports jacket at Lanvin; sneakers (of his own design) at Louis Vuitton; a snappy bow tie with a blazer at Luella; and a color-block cardigan at Jeremy Scott. West has professed a keen interest in further honing his fashion acumen and would like to intern at an established house. We can’t wait to see the results of that duet.
