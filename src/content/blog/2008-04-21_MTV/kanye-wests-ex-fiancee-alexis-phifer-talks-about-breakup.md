# Kanye West's Ex-Fiancee Alexis Phifer Talks About Breakup

## ‘It's Always Sad When Things Like This End, and We Remain Friends,' Phifer Says.

2008-04-21 *MTV*

Alexis Phifer, Kanye West's fiancée of 18 months, has confirmed that the couple's engagement is off.

"It's always sad when things like this end, and we remain friends," Phifer reportedly told People.com. "I wish him the best in his future and all of his endeavors. He's one of the most talented people I've ever met."

The site reported that Phifer, a designer, was spotted on the red carpet without her engagement ring at an "Evenings in Vogue" event on Thursday night in New York, where her clothing line, Ghita, was featured.

"They'd been having problems," a friend of West's told the site. "Kanye is really focused on his show; he's putting everything into the show right now. Alexis is a nice girl, but Kanye has been going through a rough time. They hit a rough patch and for now they've split."

The couple, who have dated on and off since 2002, got engaged over a lobster and pasta dinner during a vacation on the island of Capri in August 2006, the site reported.

A rep for West, who is currently on his Glow in the Dark Tour, had no comment.

The long-rumored news was reported earlier on Monday by UsMagazine.com.

Sources close to West had previously told Us that he would tie the knot with Phifer to honor his late mother Donda's wish that they make their relationship official
