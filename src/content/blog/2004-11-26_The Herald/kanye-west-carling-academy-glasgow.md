# Kanye West, Carling Academy, Glasgow

If support acts be the measure of a man, Kanye West is a nice one. In 2002, Talib Kweli gave then-unknown producer West a leg-up on his first solo album after Black Star. While Kweli, though hugely respected within the industry (he’s Jay-Z’s favorite MC), has never quite broken through, West, having come out from behind the mixing desk, has become one of hip-hop’s biggest stars in a matter of months and it seems he’s returning the favor. Warm feelings aside, it’s a sad reminder of the demand for commercially viable hip-hop.

Still, West is a shining example of how to strike the balance between commercially- and critically-sound music. After he bounds onstage in a patterned jumper that does nothing to quell comparisons with preppy Carlton of the Fresh Prince of Bel Air, the value of this becomes clear. About two-thirds of the way through We Don’t Care, he stops abruptly, saying he’s rapping the wrong verse. After lengthy discussions with his DJ, he just gives up and starts another song. The former producer isn’t a natural extrovert and lacks the invention to improvise, but paradoxically, what saves the performance is the strength of his production skills: the beats, hooks, and samples that provide the momentum.

There follows an all too early interlude in which West skips offstage, perhaps to recover his confidence, while his DJ does a 10-minute set. He’s old school, all elbows and legs; entertaining, but where’s West? When he returns, we get solid hits — “Workout Plan,” “Through The Wire,” and “All Falls Down” — and West pretty much covers his whole album. While his MC-ing is impeccable — intact with his trademark upward lilt at the end of each line — his stage presence is negligible. For now, West is a producer first and a performer second.
