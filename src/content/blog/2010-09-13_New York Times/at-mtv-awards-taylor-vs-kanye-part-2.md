# At MTV Awards, Taylor vs. Kanye Part 2

For the second year running at the MTV Video Music Awards, Kanye West got the last word.

Last year, he took it by force, snatching the microphone from Taylor Swift as she made her acceptance speech for the Best Female Video award, helping cement his image as an uncontrollable megalomaniac, and allowing Ms. Swift all the rights and sympathies afforded to the unjustly wronged.

But at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday night, at the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles, he was given the show’s closing performance to pay his respects, or not. (He had apologized to Ms. Swift, again, in a series of Twitter posts earlier this month.)

He opted to move on, playing “Runaway,” an alternately punishing and mesmerizing new song, full of unbleeped profanity. “You’ve been putting up with my” — antics, in a manner of speaking — “way too long,” Mr. West sang. Wearing a red suit, he looked amateurish and vulnerable, and also affecting. He ceded some of his stage time to Pusha T of Clipse, who rapped a verse, and at the chorus Mr. West chanted, self-mockingly, “Let’s have a toast to the” followed by a series of unprintable titles.

At the end, Mr. West’s knowing, bombastic humility won. The crowd chanted, “Kanye! Kanye! Kanye! Kanye!”

It was unlikely that Mr. West, who has been a pariah for most of the past year, would come off looking more magnanimous than Ms. Swift, and yet her performance, an hour earlier, felt petty by comparison. Choosing to tackle last year’s events head-on, Ms. Swift — a victim, but no naïf — performed a new song, “Innocent,” directed at Mr. West, an extremely savvy insult masquerading as the high road. She performed it with minimal accompaniment, barefoot, and with an unsteady relationship to pitch (neither she nor Mr. West were near their best).

“Who you are is not what you did,” she sang. “You’re still an innocent.” At the end of the song, she was standing alone at center stage, presumably with security guards hawkishly monitoring all the relevant checkpoints. “You’ll have new Septembers/ Every one of us has messed up too,” she sang quietly. “Lost your balance on a tightrope/ It’s never too late to get it back.”

Mr. West and Ms. Swift were just one of two main V.M.A. couples this year. The other one, Lady Gaga and Eminem, actually won awards. (Both Ms. Swift and Mr. West were nominated for one award; neither won.) Lady Gaga received 13 nominations, the most ever for an artist in a single year, and won eight awards, including Video of the Year, Best Pop Video and Best Female Video. Eminem received eight nominations, and won twice, for Best Hip-Hop Video and Best Male Video.

The V.M.A.’s were only two hours long this year — extra time could have been devoted to Lady Gaga, who used her several trips to the microphone during the show and before it to thank the late designer Alexander McQueen and her gay fans, to announce the name of her new album, “Born This Way,” and also to speak out against the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.

Eminem did not even bother with words. He has been a Video Music Award fixture for years, and so knows well what this show is best used for. After opening the night with a stark, intense performance of “Not Afraid” and, with Rihanna, “Love the Way You Lie,” he left the building, leaving others to claim his statuettes for him.

As per usual, the V.M.A.’s offered the best theater of any award show, though this year, it came in small moments: the cast of MTV’s greasy reality soap opera “Jersey Shore” making an onstage appearance in a hot tub, or Rihanna’s dismissive, hair-flipping reaction to her former flame Drake’s performance. The vast circular stage was used to vivid effect by Mr. West, who was joined by a small group of ballerinas; Usher, who channeled parkour, Cirque du Soleil, and the film “Tron” in his performance of “DJ Got Us Fallin’ In Love” and “OMG”; and also by Florence and the Machine, with Florence spending much of her rendition of “Dog Days Are Over” reclined on a platform, wearing a translucent sheath.

And then there was the awkward plight of the night’s host, Chelsea Handler. She was among the worst in the show’s history — purposefully out-of-touch, with brief, alarming flashes of off-color racial humor. On her talk show, “Chelsea Lately,” in a smaller setting, her interviews with musicians, rappers in particular, are consistently hilarious and inappropriate. Here, she never looked comfortable, undone by nerves, brittle material and the wattage of those around her.

She could have used an outburst from Mr. West — or anyone, really. In her opening monologue, she begged for a controversy: “I want to encourage everyone to be on their worst behavior,” she said.

Not this time. Mr. West’s protest last year felt quaint: he was convinced of the importance of the V.M.A.’s as an awards show, not a musical circus. His performance this year made clear that he now understood the rules. Earlier in the night, the Best Rock Video award went to the diffuse, dull “Kings and Queens,” by 30 Seconds to Mars. If Mr. West had been planning to jump out of his seat at the announcement of one of this night’s winners, that would have been the one, and yet not a peep was heard from him.
