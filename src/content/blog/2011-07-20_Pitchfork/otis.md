# “Otis”

Here’s Jay-Z on the “Otis” intro: “It sounds so soulful! Don’t you agree?” Well, yeah. If you’re willing to plunk down enough money to sample “Try a Little Tenderness”, that’ll happen. But even if the sample works as a sort of audio money-flaunt, it’s also a tough and hard chop from Kanye — Otis Redding’s magnificent voice mostly limited to a couple of hellfire grunts, the song itself held to a sharp guitar stab. And where Jay and Kanye’s previous collab “H.A.M.” was all event-rap bluster, this one is exactly the sort of fun, relaxed shit-talk these guys should be doing. Jay and Kanye trade off verses and never pause for a chorus, each one building on whatever the last guy said — an old-school rap-collab style you almost never hear anymore. And since these guys are working loose and casual, it gives them chances to show how funny and clever they are without telegraphing their own importance.

Of course, when Jay and Kanye get enough room to drop offhand comments and conversational punchlines, that’s when they actually say revealing things. So here’s Jay’s entire persona in one line: “Photo shoot fresh, lookin’ like wealth; I’m ‘bout to call the paparazzi on myself.” And here’s Kanye’s: “Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive.” Lines as sharp as those are the type of things these two come up with when they aren’t trying too hard. Last week, a few photos from the Watch the Throne sessions circulated, and the best one showed Jay and Kanye simultaneously busting up laughing. I’d like to thing that one was taken while they were writing this song.
