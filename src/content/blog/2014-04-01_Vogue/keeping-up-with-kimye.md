# Keeping Up With Kimye

# From London to Paris to Los Angeles, Hamish Bowles Joins Kim Kardashian and Kanye West in Their Quest for World Domination — And the Perfect Wedding Dress.

The fast-cooling Los Angeles afternoon air is filled with the scent of eucalyptus and mimosa, the gurgle of water as it tumbles down a fountain wall into a picture-perfect azure pool, the exultant strains of Pharrell Williams’s “Happy,” and a chorus of “Old MacDonald Had a Farm,” performed in unhappy a cappella by Annie Leibovitz and Kris Jenner.

The frantic warblings of this unlikely duo are intended to entertain the geographically named North West, perched between her father, Kanye West, creative polyglot, and his fiancee, North’s mother, Kim Kardashian, cultural phenomenon — or Kimye, as the media has dubbed the telegenic pair while it relentlessly tracks their every move. North (“Kanye’s side of the family calls her Nori,” says Kim) is poised on her mother’s knee, a knee that is currently enveloped in a fall of Lanvin satin the color and consistency of double cream, fashioned by Alber Elbaz into a wedding dress of fifties haute couture magnificence. The dress is a fitting complement to Kim’s voluptuous movie-star beauty, with her flashing Ava Gardner looks and Sophia Loren figure that have helped to establish a new contemporary body paradigm after an era of waifs.

Small wonder that Kim idolizes Elizabeth Taylor, whom she first became aware of as a supportive friend of Michael Jackson. Taylor once lent Kim her Cleopatra cape for a photo shoot, and Kim conducted Taylor’s last interview (by phone and e-mail), about her legendary jewels. “Everything seemed so selfless for her,” Kim remembers. “We talked about the jewelry and how it ultimately didn’t belong to her; she just wanted to help people.” When Taylor’s estate was sold to benefit the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation, Kim even acquired some of those jewels herself. She also went to look at Taylor’s house. “It was just so enchanting,” she remembers, “with a garden with really pretty trellises and beautiful roses, but it wasn’t realistic for me to purchase. It only had a one-car garage.”

Although North has inherited her father’s furrowed, quizzical brow, the pretty ten-month-old who is the focus of all this attention seems an island of preternatural serenity in the roiling sea of frenetic activity that is la vie Kimye.

North’s parents have already involved her in their creative lives. “I take pictures of her all the time and dress her up,” says Kim. “I put Kanye’s big chains around her, and I put a little Louis bag and some Jordans, and I was like, ‘What up, Daddy?’ “ Kanye, meanwhile, has made an adorable little stop-frame video of North caught in her natural movements that he’s edited to make it appear as if she’s break-dancing.

“Anybody need anything?” asks the agelessly glamorous, apricot-skinned Kris, fluttering eyelashes as thick, long, and lustrous as a hummingbird’s wings. “Water? Vodka? Get on my train!” she laughs. “Just kidding!” Kris (who, as Kim notes, “goes by the name of Lovey, not Grandma!”) is an astute businesswoman and an executive producer of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, now in its eighth season. Her home office is stacked with Kardashian product and magazine spreads — there is even a framed copy of her estranged husband Olympic gold medalist Bruce Jenner’s 1979 GQ cover.

When Kim was an impressionable little girl, she remembers, her fashion-mad mom “would always wear really tight — she was into Vicky Tiel, Moschino, or Chanel — with huge Moschino heart earrings. She had an amazing body and was always so in shape. One time Kourtney and I sat in my mom’s closet — we must’ve been eight or nine — and we were like, ‘If Mom dies, we’re going to write down who gets what.’ We went through every last piece of her wardrobe. We were so mean then!”

Kris, she recalls, was a firm but fun mother who gave her churchgoing daughters an idyllic childhood and a privileged life. Kim and her sisters would ride their bikes down to the Beverly Hills Hotel for breakfast and spend their days playing tennis or soccer. At one time or another Jay Leno, Bruce Springsteen, and Madonna were all neighbors. Madonna once gave a seven-year-old Kim and her sister Kourtney a box of her discarded fluorescent-rubber jewelry, although their school friends refused to believe its exciting provenance.

“We had this amazing house in Beverly Hills,” says Kim. “My dream one day is to buy it back for my mom. I actually have to get to work to make that happen. That’s my five-year plan. I want to knock on their door and say, ‘Will you please sell me this house?’ “

Kris’s present house is itself a camera-ready hymn to glamorous aspiration.

“I’m obsessed with cozy,” she says, and the va-va-voom Deco interiors are filled with comfortable soft furnishings strewn with fur and cashmere throws and scattered with silk cushions. A fire blazes in the entrance hall, casting its flickering light on the giant marble checkerboard floor and catching the folds of the silver lame curtains tied back with tassels of Swarovski jet-black crystals. Family pictures abound — Kris even has some framed images of her underwear-clad daughters from the 2011 Kardashian Kollection for Sears campaign shot by Leibovitz. Kim politely disabuses Annie of the notion that they might have been put here expressly for the shoot (“She’s always had them; she loves them,” she assures her). There is a wall densely hung with elaborately staged Christmas portraits of the ever-expanding Kardashian-Jenner family. “We’ve done it since I was born,” explains Kim, who stares out from her childhood pictures with an almost otherworldly beauty. Suddenly, however, those Kardashian girls are all grown up and vamping in body-con gowns. David LaChapelle, maestro of all-American kitsch, shot their most recent Christmas group.

For the moment, Kim and Kanye are camping out chez Kris while their own rambling new manse in the hills of Bel Air is being readied for their burgeoning family. Kanye’s old house has been deemed to have “no privacy and no space,” whereas Kris lives in a gated community trellised by horse walks and dotted with Disney-perfect stables. However, Kanye’s erstwhile home serves its purpose: “We use the whole bottom floor for storage,” says Kim, who keeps the majority of her wardrobe there. “We have a ‘walk in’ house!” Kanye jokes. It’s also, Kim admits, “the place that we go when we want to get away because there’s a lot going on at my mom’s house. His house is very calm and tonal.”

Kris had just finished decorating a spare bedroom at her house in lush draperies and dark jewel colors when North arrived, but graciously ceded a redo to the couple. Now Tord Boontje’s iconic Swarovski pink blossom chandelier twinkles above a Lucite crib and pale-colored shag-pile carpeting, all reflected in a narcissism-nurturing mirrored wall.

It would appear that Kanye applies the same collaborative spirit that informs his music to his decorating projects, as well as the concept of sampling. Claudio Silvestrin, the former partner of John Pawson, worked with him on the New York apartment he acquired a decade ago, transforming it into a serene minimalist tone poem in limestone and pear wood. Meanwhile he is working on the Paris apartment he has had for two years with Oana Stanescu, as well as Joseph Dirand, the design comet whose commercial projects include store concepts for Alexander Wang, Balmain, and Rick Owens, and who, in Kanye parlance, “killed it” with his Deco-fabulous scheme for Monsieur Bleu, the eatery of the moment at the Palais de Tokyo. Dirand “taught me about Corbusier and Jeanneret and Perriand,” says Kanye, “but he gets everything — bases everything off of Versailles.” The apartment’s floors were inspired by the distinguished Belgian antiquaire and interior designer Axel Vervoordt, whose exquisite, moated Kasteel van ’s-Gravenwezel, a showplace for his work, left Kanye suitably awed when he toured it a couple of years ago. All of them seem to have been consulted for Kimye’s Bel Air project, as well as Waldo Fernandez, Sandy Gallin, and Clint Nicholas.

“Kim is like a fantasy, period,” says Kanye. “She’s like a dream girl. And I think a dream girl should live in a dream world”

“I’m looking at all of this sci-fi, retro-future stuff, muted color palettes” for both his homes and his music projects, says Kanye, nestled with his fiancee in an accommodating banquette in Kris’s shagadelic den-cum-bar. “Starting to build one language, you know?”

His aesthetic partnerships are as thoughtfully curated as his architect choices; Kanye collaborated with the performance artist Vanessa Beecroft on his 2013 Yeezus tour, fusing a plethora of ideas into a singular aesthetically cohesive concept. He considers his music “a sonic painting. I’m not music. I’m not fashion,” he explains. “I’m just art. Life is a giant art project.” Right now he is working on his logo with Peter Saville, the legendary art director famed for his collaborations with Joy Division in the eighties. “Album covers and stuff — that shit is serious to me,” he maintains.

“Creativity is hard,” he observes. “The creative process — it’s like a relationship: It can be grueling, it can be extremely fun, it can be extremely fulfilling, it can be extremely daunting. Do you want to put out currently acceptable stuff, or do you want to try to push toward the future and try to expand?

“You need new ideas,” he continues, relating the concept to his architectural projects, “but Sandy Gallin’s older, Axel Vervoordt is older, so they’ve lived. Claudio will be like, ‘I’ve been through three marriages — and we need to have two bathrooms!’ “

Kanye is surprised that this mix-and-match approach has raised eyebrows in the design world. “Wait a second; Walt Disney worked with a lot of different animators,” he notes. “When I work with music, I work with a lot of different people. If you work together, you can find something greater — and all people can win.

“I’m really into fantasy, as you know. I’m obsessed with Walt Disney and Tim Burton and Hayao Miyazaki. Kim is like a fantasy, period,” he says. “She’s like a dream girl. And I think a dream girl should live in a dream world.”

“I do live in a dream world,” says Kim. “The fact that I’m waking up tomorrow, shooting for VOGUE, I get to play dress-up every single day of my life, have my dream fiance, my dream baby, you know?”

Ten days earlier, Kim began her VOGUE wedding-dress odyssey in London in the light-flooded atelier of Alexander McQueen’s Sarah Burton, where, under conditions of absolute secrecy, Catherine Middleton’s magnificent dress for her marriage to Britain’s future king was conceived and fashioned. For Kim, Sarah has designed a dress with ostrich-feather panniers and a train, and a bodice of plumes, adapted from one in her debut collection that Daphne Guinness wore to the Met Costume Institute’s McQueen-themed gala in 2011. The feather tendrils have been sewn by hand onto a chiffon base, and the imposing dress is light as a cloud.

Kim arrived exultant, having successfully managed to throw off the 30 or so paparazzi that had been her near-constant shadows. She evaded them by dodging into Selfridges (“It’s the only place I know here,” she said), where luckily she ran into a friend and they conspired to switch cars.

“I’ve always been fine with it,” Kim tells me later of the constant paparazzi monitoring. “I think only when I got pregnant did I start to have a problem because they were so nasty to me — the things they would say. I’ve never really recovered. And they still say crazy things when I’m with my daughter and make it a scary situation. When you’re young and you’re riding around L.A. with your friends it’s fun and exciting, but now I’m in my 30s and don’t really care to go out and be seen or impress anybody.”

Kim is wearing a pearl-buttoned Celine overcoat, black leggings, and a pair of beloved Margiela boots that Kanye bought for her in 2008 (“I was like, ‘What’s Margiela?’ back then,” she notes wryly), but all eyes are on The Ring, a prettily faceted fifteen-carat cushion-cut diamond that Kanye, after consulting a number of other jewelers, eventually chose from Lorraine Schwartz and had set to hover on a dainty mount. “He did so good,” says Kim, “I just stare at it all day.”

Kanye presented it to her on her thirty-third birthday in the baseball stadium in San Francisco (where he was performing), flying the entire clan Kardashian in for support.

“It was the most special day of my life,” remembers Kim, who discovered a 50-piece orchestra waiting for her. “The lights go on and they start playing my favorite Lana Del Rey song, ‘Young and Beautiful,’ from The Great Gatsby. It just reminds me of us.” Kim thought that Kanye had hired Del Rey to serenade her for her birthday. “That’s so something he would do!” she says, suggesting he is even more romantic than a character in a movie. “Literally, he is the most romantic person I’ve ever even heard of.” But then the scoreboard flashed, PLEEEASE MARRY MEEE!!!, and Kanye went down on bended knee.SCREEN TIME

From London, Kim decamped to Paris to join Kanye and meet with more designers who have created couture looks for the VOGUE shoot. It is a city dear to the couple’s hearts. Kanye discovered it when Damon Dash took him to Europe some ten years ago, “before I even dropped the first album. Paris is like the girl that’s rude to you at a bar at first, and then you eventually fall in love with her the most.” It was a slow burn for Kim, too. “Now I absolutely love it,” she says, “but I remember the first time I went it seemed like such a different world to me. Paris is the place we go when we want to get away,” she adds. “People don’t hound you here. At night when we’re jet-lagged we just throw on sweats and take a walk around the city and window-shop in the middle of the night.”

They love the city so much, in fact, that they are planning their upcoming nuptials here.

“People are probably assuming we’re going to have this massive wedding,” says Kim, “and I think that it will be — but intimate. Two hundred people — just all of our closest friends — a special night for us and all the people that really love us and that have supported us.” Intimate or not, Kim is planning multiple costume changes, and Kanye, naturally, is thinking iconic. The Louvre, perhaps, or Versailles. Or both. “We could get the Hall of Mirrors or something,” says Kanye. “We could turn up.”

As the couple prepares for another round of fittings, their close friend and Kanye collaborator (on the artwork for the Watch the Throne album) Riccardo Tisci joins them for dinner with Pedro Almodovar chez Azzedine Alaia and takes the group around that fashion maestro’s emporium for a late-night shop. “I did a personal styling of Kim, all Alaia,” Riccardo tells me, noting that the designer was naturally enamored of Kim’s hourglass proportions. “He was blown away: He loved.”

Riccardo has some firm words of advice for Kanye on the subject of the actual dress his future bride will wear to the altar. Namely, not to get involved in the process. “Let her live; it’s her dress,” Riccardo counsels him, rushing in where angels fear to tread. “It’s got to be her dream, not your dream — a surprise when she walks up the aisle.” (“I’m very feminist, very ‘sister’ in that way!” Riccardo confides.)

As Kim tries on her dresses in a setting of Middletonian discretion and subterfuge at Le Meurice, “I decided to not have any opinions,” says a chastened Kanye playfully, installed on a gray sofa, when asked if he prefers the flat or the heel with the look. “Flat is cooler, no?” posits Riccardo, “but high heels will make her stronger.”

“I tried to do flats when I was pregnant,” says Kim. “Couldn’t do it.”

Today the dresses that form the dream girl’s extravagant VOGUE “wedding” trousseau are hanging in Mom’s closet in Los Angeles, with its mirror door covered in her daughters’ lipstick kisses.

Ensconced in her mother’s commodious makeup chair the first morning of the shoot, in the generous mirrored room arranged for just this purpose, surrendering to the ministrations of the hair and makeup team, Kim declares this to be “my favorite part of the day! If I could do this every day of the year I would.” (Her new manse includes just such a room, an improvement on the “years when we used to get ready in the kitchen.”) “I feel odd when I don’t wear makeup!” she says with a laugh. “I don’t recognize myself.”

Kim is catching up with herself on dailymail.co.uk (“That is my favorite Web site of all time!”) but isn’t yet up to speed with all the Oscar movies. “I just love a romantic comedy and a love story,” she says, sighing. “I could watch love stories all day.” (That evening, she and Kanye go to the Westfield Topanga mall to see Her, Spike Jonze’s love story about a lonely divorce who falls for an operating-system avatar. They both adore it.) “There’s nothing that we love more than to just hang out and go to movies,” says Kim. “So we drive to Malibu or Santa Barbara and figure out how to get to places alone.”

Kim is astonished by the revelation that Woody Harrelson refuses to put a cell phone to his ear. “I’d rather have a few years off my life,” she avers. “We spend sometimes six or eight hours on the phone every day, especially with all of our traveling. We just sit on the phone and talk about anything and everything.”

These freewheeling conversations must be riveting: The couple have such different takes on the world. “Will Tom Ford do another movie?” Kanye will wonder, for instance. “Creative people can create what they want. Directors are creative with color palettes, design sensibility, and of course photography and how to tell stories.”

Kim’s engagement with Tom Ford’s oeuvre is more subjective. She has been an obsessive eBay shopper since she persuaded her father to lend her the money to invest in half a dozen pairs of Manolo Blahnik’s Timberland-inspired Oklamod ankle boots, as worn by Beyonce in her 2003 “Bonnie & Clyde” video and J.Lo in “Jenny from the Block.” Kim immediately flipped them on eBay for a vast profit. She admits to an ongoing eBay addiction, shopping at night “as I’m falling asleep.” A year ago she craved a pair of Tom Ford boots but had to settle on them a size too small. She has finally acquired a pair in her size. “Two seasons past and I still love them and I don’t care.”

As a couple, she and Kanye bonded over fashion, and her sensibility has, she says, been refined through their connection. “I liked a more glamorous aesthetic,” she says, “but I think that it’s simplified, and I love that. I love evolving. I just think I’ve been educated a little bit better.” Mass is a concept central to her taste, but she says it is more nuanced now. “I love mixing high and low. I love going to Paris and finding a great piece that I know no one else can find and then coming home and putting it with a skirt that I got for under 20 bucks at Sears, and it looks cool.”

When Kim appears for her next shot, in a Dolce & Gabbana Alta Moda gown, an eighteenth-century fantasia of tea-stained silk tulle and endless lengths of handmade lace, with ruffles at the elbows and a Madame du Barry neckline, there are oohs and aahs all around. “I just love to be so over-the-top,” says Kim. “It’s to die for,” says Kris. “You look so pretty, it’s crazy how pretty you look! I’m trying not to be the controlling mother,” she adds, laughing, as she adjusts the train. She needn’t worry: Kanye is giving her a run for her money. He is currently tweaking the gown’s sweetheart neckline, which he has likened to a McDonald’s M. “I want to make it heart-shaped,” he says, “more graphic, more modern. You can still soften it with the chiffon.” Kim’s eyes roll discreetly to the silver-leafed ceiling.

“I’m really big on necklines,” says Kanye with masterly understatement. “I research T-shirt shapes because that’s what we do, me and my crew at Donda [the creative-design agency, named for his late mother, that, as Kanye once tweeted, “will galvanize amazing thinkers and put them in a creative space to bounce their dreams and ideas . . .”]. We master T-shirts — the Yeezus-tour T-shirts, Pyrex, Been Trill, Fear of God, even normal T-shirts with nothing on them. We literally tailor T-shirts. We take that type of stuff superseriously. A neckline means the difference — for women and men.”

Kanye abhors what he describes as a “mall-T-shirt neckline” and wears his own cut low enough to reveal a flash of Jacob the Jeweler’s diamond-encrusted heavy gold chain and an erogenous slice of his clavicle. “This is our form of cleavage, right here,” he explains.

“Is that a really weird thing to be into — the neckline of a T-shirt?” he queries rhetorically. “Because, for a guy, all that matters is really jeans and a T-shirt, a nice suit every now and then, and working out.

“What I love about being motivated by Kim,” says Kanye, “is I don’t rest on the laurels of creativity or just the product that I put out. I also think it’s important to work out. I don’t care how good of a thinker you are, you can’t ask someone else to work out for you!”

After the first day of shooting chez Kris, Kim is curled up with Kanye, wearing a robe and furry UGG flip-flops — Kanye removed the bows, and now they look like Celine. He has an upcoming East Coast tour, so Kim will accompany him before she returns to shoot season nine of her show (a five-month process). They have a nursery backstage at every venue so North “can be in the back while we watch the show,” says Kim. “She sleeps through it all: She has these little headphones.”

The couple first met in a recording studio in 2003, when Kim was with her good friend Brandy, for whom she onetime acted as stylist. Kim had a boyfriend at the time, so they didn’t connect romantically. “Basically, you know, she was always my favorite girl,” says Kanye. “There was no girl in the world that could pull me away from her.”

“Awww,” purrs Kim, “that’s so cute.”

Kanye later cast Kim as a scantily dressed Princess Leia in the pilot for Alligator Boots, a raunchy “hip-hop Muppet Show.”

“I was like, Oh, my God. He’s really funny and he’s really cool,” remembers Kim. “It took a couple years for us to figure it out . . . but we always stayed friends. They say the first year of a relationship is tough, but imagine adding so many people — just the world — into the mix.”

When their friendship finally segued into something else, Kanye experienced a new level of public scrutiny. “We both went from being single to being together — and also really public together,” he says. “The combination has just been . . . nuclear.”

He is philosophical about the setbacks. “It’s hard to be the first,” he says. “And, yes, we want to be the first and the best — that might come off the wrong way, but it’s true. You’re the one that runs into the woods for the first time and comes back with all the scratches on your face,” he says by way of analogy. “But anytime they make a mockery of us, they are not looking at the ground we are breaking but just making jokes out of the scratches we got on our face.”

“That’s what I love about him,” says Kim, “because every time he’ll say to me, ‘OK, it’s never been done before, but we will do it. We will be the first.’ I feel like our whole lives are just meshed together,” she adds. “I think we really value and respect each other’s opinions.” For Kim, the hardest part of the relationship is “trying to keep the outside world from breaking into our bond.”

“Once you get a wifey, your wifey basically runs your life. Everything you do is based on wifey,” says Kanye with a laugh. “It’s really interesting that we’re on the front lines of a few different concepts at the same time,” he continues, serious this time. “You’ve got the interracial thing; you have mega-media and mega-art crash; you have, you know, the VOGUE-and-reality show combination. There’s a lot of new frontiers being broken in 2014.”

But for Kanye, “that’s what the world is. That’s the future, this melting pot, crashing sensibilities together,” a vision of which he and Kim are the nonpareil exemplars. “She created something really powerful that the universe connected with,” he says, “and I created something that people connected with, and then when we combine our information. . . .We can help communicate and educate and just bring more dopeness in general. It’s really just about dopeness at the end of the day.”

At the end of the day, Kanye is having a raw-food meal prepared, and Kim is in the kitchen eyeing the glass cake stands bearing cookies shaped like fish, pigs, ice-cream cones, and frogs.

Her sisters are calling left and right, suspicious that she has been off the radar for a day. This is a very close family. “What do you guys think I’m up to?” Kim asks them, disingenuously. “Kanye took me to a romantic dinner in the middle of nowhere, and we had something to eat.” Which wasn’t a lie, she tells me, sotto voce. “We had an In-N-Out burger!”
