# Surprised Kanye Got So Many Grammy Nods? He Sure Isn't

## Rapper/Producer Has Been Talking Himself Up for Years.

Before people knew who Kanye West was or how much talent he possessed, the rapper/producer knew his own worth — and he wasn't afraid to tell anybody. At first some laughed, some humored him, but gradually everybody came around. And now that he's garnered 10 Grammy nominations, no one can front on him.

"I'm just overwhelmed," Kanye said on Tuesday about how he felt after receiving the Grammy nods (see "Kanye Scores 10 Grammy Nominations; Usher And Alicia Keys Land Eight" ). "There was a lot of pain that went into my career, just of getting dissed so much, that you're not used to people actually acknowledging how much work that you put in. So for people to come and give me Grammy nominations for 'Jesus Walks', Song of the Year, Artist of the Year, it's just overwhelming, it's vindicating."

So now he can say, "I told you so." Here, we've put together some of the prophetic and very, shall we say, confident statements West has made to MTV News over the last few years.

- “I was always confident in myself that whatever I put my all into, I could do it. I always believed in myself. When I had wack rhymes, I thought they was hot." — June 19, 2002

- “My job is to break down the barriers and show music is just music. On one hand, I've got a knowledge of my heritage; I got a pretty good background, I've been to school. But on the other hand, I like strippers. So do I not talk about strippers because I'm educated? Do I not talk about education because I like strippers? Nobody can pigeonhole me and determine what I talk about. — June 19, 2002

- “People would say to me, 'Yo man, I'm sorry that happened. You can't die before we work together.' " — Kanye on other artists wishing him well after his car accident, December, 10, 2002

- “Jay-Z can't be any more backpack than he is already, and Talib Kweli can't be any more commercial than he is already. Somehow I fit in the center of them both. I'm not too much either way, so I fall between everything. I'm like the 2003 A Tribe Called Quest — I'm A Guy Called West." — June 5, 2003

- “I don't want to talk about it before it comes out, but it'll be unbelievable." — Kanye on producing songs for Janet Jackson's album Damita Jo, October 16, 2003

- “I’m asking you all, I'm begging you all, if y'all feel this is a zero, give it a zero. If you feel like it is a five, give it a five. If y'all believe that this is the future, which is what I believe ... If y'all feel like this is what the game needs right now, if y'all feel I delivered what y'all all been waiting for, then ... I'm asking you all not to let the future pass you by and be a part of history, 'cause this is history in the making, man." — Kanye, standing on a table, addressing a group of journalists who were previewing his The College Dropout album, February 2004

- “Would it be arrogance or confidence? Because I'm outspoken? Or because I feel confident? I feel like I have the right to tell you. I really like my raps." — February 2004

- “All of the [videos] are groundbreaking. That song evokes so much emotion, and four minutes of imagery limits the ideas that you're supposed to give for the songs, so I had to do three." — Kanye on his three different videos for "Jesus Walks," June 22, 2004

- “I felt like I was definitely robbed and I refused to give any politically correct bullsh-- ass [comment]. I make the music from my heart ... and to be able to get 'Jesus Walks' on the radio and everything that's happening, I was the best new artist this year, so get that other bullsh-- out of here." — Kanye venting about not winning Best New Artist of the Year at the American Music Awards, November 14, 2004
