# Kanye’s Grand Paris Plan

## How Do West and Kim Kardashian Top a Fortress Wedding? Avow Renewal in the Eiffel Tower, Naturally

Subtlety isn’t Kanye West’s strong suit. Unable to spend Mother’s Day with Kim Kardashian, the rapper, 37, sent “a couple thousand roses” to his wife’s hotel suite in Säo Paulo, she revealed May 10. At dinner with friends that evening, a string quartet serenaded her with ballads by pal Sam Smith. “Every single waiter who brought food said ‘This is from Mr. West for the best mother in the world’!” the Selfish author, 34, posted on Instagram. “Seriously I have the best husband ever!”

Now Yeezy has an even more grandiose gesture up his Givenchy sleeve. “Kanye is planning something extravagant for them to renew their vows,” a Kardashian source says of their May 24 first wedding anniversary. His bright idea, according to the source: renting out the Eiffel Tower as the site of the celebration! (The tower’s swanky 58 Tour Eiffel restaurant is booked for aprivate event that night.) The fete will cap off the couple’s trip to France, where, sources say, they’ll also attend the Cannes film festival.

The romantic venue is fitting. Kardashian once said that the duo “fell in love in Paris,” and has gushed of their rendezvous in the City of Light: “He’ll wake me up in the middle of the night and just want to go walking as the streets are empty.”

## Baby Woes

Post-vows, they’ll work on filling their home. For the past year, the parents of North, 23 months, have been trying for baby No. 2. “Kim is desperate to get pregnant,” says a second source, adding that the® star began in vitro fertilization. And though she told Today’s Matt Lauer April 27 that doctors “recommended to me to get a surrogate,” she hopes to conceive naturally. Adds another pal, “She won’t do that until she exhausts doing it on her own.” US
