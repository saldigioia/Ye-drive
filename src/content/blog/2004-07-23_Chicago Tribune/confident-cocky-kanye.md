# Confident. Cocky. Kanye.

Even Kanye West's friends are quick to point out that the 26- 26-year-old wunderkind believes in himself, to put it mildly. But the Chicago-bred music maker has every reason to feel good about his career direction right now. West's solo debut, "College Dropout," is one of 2004's unrivaled success stories -- reaching multiplatinum status in the U.S. and remaining in the Top 20 of the Billboard album chart 23 weeks after it dropped--and his resume contains more hits than a heavyweight title fight.

Of course, superstardom comes with a price. West claims his already busy life has shifted into overdrive: He can't leave the house by himself anymore, everyone and their grandmother wants a remix or a beat, and the pressure's on to follow "Dropout" with an equally chart-busting collection. But West isn't concerned. He's on top of the world--exactly where he has always thought he belonged.

West phoned *RedEye* to chat, and he did, discussing everything from his favorite Chicago eateries (Harold's Chicken Shack, Leon's Bar-B-Que, Maxine's Caribbean Spice) to his misunderstood sense of humor.

**When you were growing up in Chicago, did you know Twista?**

The first rapper I met was Common, but after that, I met Twista. When I was real young, he would come by my house and listen to beats.

**Back then, did you guys believe you'd make it this far?**

We wouldn't have got this far if we didn't think we could.

**Do you think Chicago has its own hip-hop sound?**

You talking about the Chicago sound that I made that is the Chicago sound? That'd be like asking Dr. Dre: "Do you think there's an L.A. sound?" Asking the creator of it. That's kind of like a discredit to what I've actually done, that question is. You mean like the "Slow Jamz" song or the "Do or Die" song, or "Overnight Celebrity?" Yeah, I think we definitely have our own sound now. My sound.

**Is there anybody you'd still like to work with?**

Not really.

**Are there people you've had to turn down?**

If there was, I wouldn't put it in black and white and let that be the headline. I have to turn down a lot of people now. There was a certain point in the earlier part of the year where I'd blown up, and we had so many songs on the radio--every song after that was just a prostitute of the sound. If you want to have longevity, you can't prostitute your sound like that and let everybody have it. In fact, that's the stupidest thing you could do. I've done a couple of stupid tracks, and I won't do 'em anymore.

**Which ones were the stupid tracks?**

What are you going for here? Do you think I would say that and have that artist read it and be like, "Oh damn. He's talking bad about my music." When I say stupid, I mean it's stupid for everyone to use my sound if I'm trying to have longevity. Could you picture Kurt Cobain producing Counting Crows' first single and giving them the Nirvana sound, which takes away from Nirvana? It's at that point. My dream was always to be a solo artist, and really, I just did beats for other people to make ends meet.

**Your song "All Falls Down" talks about materialism. Do you think hip-hop promotes materialism?**

Yeah, hip-hop promotes a lot of things, and that's one of them.

**Do you think that's a problem?**

No, not at all. I don't think anything is a problem other than a song being whack.

**There's an arena tour with Usher on the horizon. How do you mentally prepare for that?**

I don't know; I just do it. That's my mentality on everything. Preparing might stress you out too much. I'm just happy to be here. We begged to get on the tour, and we got the opportunity, and it's just me and him going out. To go rock arenas with just us two says a lot about both the artists on the tour.

**You strike me as a pretty confident guy. Do you worry about being perceived as arrogant?**

No, I think everybody else is concerned about it.

**How do you mean?**

I think the statement is more powerful if I don't explain it out to you. It would be an insult to the really intelligent people that are reading this.

**What do you think of the current state of music?**

I think music is always equally as good every year. There's about the same amount of good songs out that you love and about the same amount of [bleep]. The cream rises to the top, and only the greatest get remembered.

**How would you like to be remembered?**

I want people to think I was whack as hell, but how good as my music is, I think that's gonna be pretty hard.

**Do you have any final words for your fans in Chicago?**

I wanna thank everybody that can actually understand my sense of humor.

**And for those who don't?**

I have nothing to say.
