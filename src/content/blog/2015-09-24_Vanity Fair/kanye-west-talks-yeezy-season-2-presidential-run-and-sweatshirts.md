# Kanye West Talks Yeezy Season 2, Presidential Run, and Sweatshirts

Outside the Mercer hotel at 4:30 P.M. on Wednesday, September 16, the scene was chaos, with squads of paparazzi and camera-phone-wielding fans tumbling into the cobbled SoHo streets. Inside, the object of their attention lay stretched across a sofa in a corner of the crowded lobby and appeared to sleep. Four hours earlier, Kanye West had unveiled the second season of his Yeezy clothing line at a live New York show that was also streamed to 40 movie theaters across the globe, and seven days of round-the-clock preparations had caught up with him. As West readily acknowledges, the Yeezy concept is in its early stages, but with its muted color palette, insistent focus on elevating everyday staples like sweatshirts and army jackets, and diverse cast of models, his presentation was much closer to the way we live now than many of the more established shows that took place during New York Fashion Week. West opened his eyes, greeted a reporter, and began to talk about the lessons he’s learned in design, his long-awaited new album, and his presidential plans. His words were as provocative as ever, but they were delivered with a striking calm. For now, at least, he seems content to be the still center of the storm.

**Vanity Fair:** Was it harder or easier this time?

**Kanye West:** It was calmer.

**Was that deliberate?**

Yeah, we just wanted to have a really Zen vibe in the studio and backstage. The team has worked together longer now, plus we have a few new recruits. But it was equally hard, it’s always hard. It always takes so many hours. I slept at the studio and I would have dreams or nightmares about the look board.

**When did you start working on this collection?**

The day after the last collection. Like, right now I’m thinking about Season 3. It’s a long, long run. Unfortunately for me, I have a lot of visibility on my side which has tended to be a thing that creates a distraction to the creative process, like paparazzi showing up at my office in Calabasas. But I almost feel I’m growing just like my daughter. I hear my daughter start to say exactly what she wants and to finish sentences and I think it’s like that. Like, maybe I got to finish a couple more sentences in the second one than in the first one.

**How do you juggle designing a collection with everything else you have going on?**

It’s family first. And then when I work on music, I’ll sequester myself and work on it with a team of three, four, or five really focused experts for two weeks at a time. And then with apparel, the office is right across from my house, so I go to the office every day.

**So is it two separate teams for music and apparel or are they interconnected?**

Of course, when we do music for the [fashion] show, I use my music guys. When we’re lighting the show, I use my lighting guy that I use for the tour. And Vanessa [Beecroft, the conceptual artist who choreographs the Yeezy shows] deftly weaves through what we do for music performances and also for the performance we did today.

**I’d like to talk about the performance. It was very deliberate the way it started with the group of very blonde people in beige tones, and then it built and the last few groups of models were all black. Could that be read as any kind of political statement or was that just to create a visual story?**

It had nothing to do with race. It was only colors of human beings and the way these palettes of people work together and really just stressing the importance of color, the importance of that to our sanity, these Zen, monochrome palettes. I’ve stayed in a Claudio Silvestrin apartment since I was 26, and I love those types of palettes and that’s my opinion. And I have this opportunity to work with amazing professionals to get this painting across. I want it to become more of a moving painting than a political statement or a fashion statement. This is strictly … not strictly, you can take it how you want; obviously I’m a very socially charged human being. But at the end of the day, I’m just simply an artist trying to express myself, trying to finish my sentences just like my daughter can.

**In terms of the soundtrack, was there a reason you chose that particular song, “Fade”?**

We had a couple options and I just thought it sounded good against the people. For the 40 theaters across the globe, for the kids that all went to see it in theaters, I thought they’d be happy to hear some new music. I’ve been doing that [making a new album] too. That’s like a sonic landscape, a two-year painting. That song I played has been a year and a half in the making and it may be still a year from being complete. But it was to let people get a glimpse at the painting.

**I know we’re here to talk about the fashion, but people are just a little bit interested in the album. It could be another year?**

I’m not sure. I’m not worried about the years. I’m worried about the life and the body of work that I can put out while I’m breathing.

**There was a continuation in terms of the clothes. It wasn’t a 180-degree turn like some designers do each season. Why is it important to you to develop in that way?**

I’m not trying to particularly give a design opinion. I have friends who are designers who are so amazingly prolific that if I was even to try to step into that territory, I’d be completely crushed. But there’s something about the way clothes fit and feel and the emotion that they give you and the details of them that I’ve been passionate about and addicted to since I was five years old. And now it’s just taking a vintage sample from Bob Melet [owner of Melet Mercantile, a vintage-fashion resource] and wondering who was the genius behind this track jacket from 1975?

How did they do that? What zipper are they using? How do we make our proposition more authentic? This is a sportswear concept and sportswear is less than 100 years old. If we’re lucky, we live 100 years. Sportswear is less than 100 years old, so we are in the middle of the expression right now for what this will say for human existence. There’s something that the Romans, they presented, that the Egyptians, they presented. With us, we have a time now that’s a mix between music, the advent of rock ’n’ roll to hip-hop, the 808 drum machine, the concept of tennis shoes or the sweatshirt. Where can that go?

**That loose silhouette, combined with the bodysuits that are skintight, you feel that’s how people want to dress now?**

I think people just wear yoga pants and sweatshirts, and I wanted to make the most beautiful version of that possible.

**You worked with the stylist Joe McKenna on this show. Was there a lot of back and forth around how you put each look together?**

I don’t know how much he would want me to talk about the process. He doesn’t even have photographs out there. He definitely didn’t sign up to become more famous. I don’t want to put that upon him if he doesn’t want it… . Me and Vanessa really felt it was important to have the opportunity for him to take a look at it, at least just take a look at it and see the things up close and see if I’m trying to say something that could be of value… . We talked about Legos before, the Lego story when they figured out how to make however many combinations out of six pieces. They’re the kind of things we narrowed down to show. What are pieces that you have to have in your wardrobe? This season I could see the store. I always envision this store where the colors are hung on the racks like a group of flowers, like [the Belgian designer] Dries [van Noten]’s garden—Dries showed me his garden—and I was just wanting the colors to fit together in this way, like where my daughter takes the four Play-Dohs and starts to blend them all up together. I can smell the store right now. I can see the wood in my head, this beat-up wood. I can feel the energy of the space. I’ve already embraced the moment of when I finally get to have my own store, which was always a dream of mine. So even though we do really amazing sales online, my dream is just to have my own store. And to have multiples of it.

**Do you have a date in mind for the first store?**

*A woman approaches the booth.*

**Woman:** Pardon, I got my U.S. citizenship today so I can work for you.

**West:** Oh, wow.

**Woman:** [Unfolding her naturalization certificate] Yeah, I have to show you the papers, man. I was born in Jamaica.

**West:** What? Awesome.

**Woman:** I got to meet your baby. I got to buy her some gifts. I’m around, so I’ll just ship it to your doorman, O.K.?

**West:** O.K., cool.

**That reminds me, we have to speak about the presidential campaign in a bit. But coming back to the stores, do you have concrete plans at this time?**

The only concrete plan is that I plan to use concrete.

**The clothing is no longer a collaboration with Adidas? The shoes are with Adidas, but the clothing collection is your own thing?**

Yeah, we do the shoes with Adidas and this past season we just did apparel on our own out of Calabasas with a small team traveling to the dye houses and making the patterns and just working 30 hours a day against all odds. We didn’t sleep. We’re in the middle of negotiations [with backers] is the best way I can put it, so there was questions on do we wait till next fall, do we come back and show something for spring? And I felt bad. The biggest thing was not only the engagement with the public that are interested to come to the movie theaters to see it or to see it online and talk about it. It was also the relationship with the stores. I felt the responsibility to come back for spring and deliver that next collection because, at this stage, as early as I am into expressing myself and making clothes, it’s just way too privileged to take a season off. Are you fucking kidding me? My toe is barely in the door, my foot is barely on the gas, I’ve got to press down harder. The most successful thing about the second season was just doing the second season.

Every time, the most successful thing about it is doing it.

**Were you happy with the reaction to the first collection?**

I think the entire fashion world at a certain point sort of looks at me and looks at my family as a child of theirs. Maybe not someone that completely grew up with them, but like an adopted child that came in, like a 17-year-old adoptee, you know [Laughs]. But still nonetheless like an adopted child. And I think it’s just interesting for them to see growth, and they can completely tell the difference in the way things were presented in the very first Paris collections to what we’re saying now.

**But if the fashion world accepts you too much, does that mean you’re doing something wrong? If there’s no controversy…**

Yeah, well, eventually I want the whole world to accept me and I want the whole world to accept each other. My vision of life is that we have all of the information to live in a better world, but we’re always holding information back… . In general the world is stingy with information. Information is the most important thing we have. Anytime I’ve ever had someone who intentionally held information from me in order to either control or manipulate the situation, be in charge of it in a certain way, that is the greatest travesty. I’d rather someone be hateful. It’s like being a fucking thief, you’re stealing information. It’s like when we go and we launch yeezy.supply, taking back the data is so important. And even musicians, for so long we were held back from our data. Meaning the record labels could have the data, but the musicians couldn’t have the data. This is the new world. The Internet’s like the Wild, Wild West. If you have your data, you have everything. You know the people that are connecting with you …

I think that the world can be helped through design. Because we don’t just sit up there and read the fucking [look] board. We look at it and we ask hours and hours and hours of questions, and the better people that you have in the room and the more information you have, the better opportunity you have of making a great decision and of creating a great proposal that people will connect to. I want everyone to win. When I run for president, I’d prefer not to run against someone. I would be like “I want to work with you.” As soon as I heard [Ben] Carson speak, I tried for three weeks to get on the phone with him. I was like this is the most brilliant guy. And I think all the people running right now have something that each of the others needs. But the idea of this separation and this gladiator battle takes away from the main focus that the world needs help and the world needs all the people in a position of power or influence to come together.

**Sounds like a presidential stump speech to me. Are you still thinking of running in 2020?**

Oh, definitely.

**When you said that at the V.M.A.s, I thought the reaction was surprising. People didn’t seem to dismiss the idea. You would have thought there would be more of an outcry.**

Especially from the six years of this misconception or the six years I went through of “We don’t like Kanye.” And then as soon as I said that, it was like, “Wait a second, we would really be into that, because actually if you think about it, he’s extremely thoughtful. Every time he’s ever gotten in trouble, he was really jumping in front of a bullet for someone else. He’s probably the most honest celebrity that we have.” I didn’t approach that because I thought it would be fun. It wasn’t like, Oh, let’s go rent some jet skis in Hawaii. No, the exact opposite. I sit in clubs and I’m like, Wow, I’ve got five years before I go and run for office and I’ve got a lot of research to do, I’ve got a lot of growing up to do. My dad has two masters degrees. My mom has a PhD, she used to work at Operation PUSH. Somehow the more and more creative I get, the closer and closer I get to who I was as a child. When I was a child, I was holding my mom’s hand at Operation PUSH. I think it’s time. Rap is great.

It’s fun. It’s fun to be a rock star, and I’ll never not be one I guess, but there’ll be a point where I become my mother’s child. With all the things I’ve done that people would consider to be accomplishments, what’s the point where I become the person that Donda and Raymond West raised? My parents’ child.

**Will you have to give up your creative projects if you run?**

I think about that. Because it’s so therapeutic for me to sit and work for seven days. We work on the collection year-round, every day to the office, we have an amazing team, but then you have that seven days before the show where you just really, really don’t sleep… . I have to stay creative. The whole point is to have someone [in office] that’s creative, that’s around amazing creatives. This is my theory: I think the world can be helped through design, so it’s very important that I stay around creative, forward thinkers. It’s very important that I continue to design, to be in practice of trying to make the best decisions possible. I hate politics. I’m not a politician at all. I care about the truth and I just care about human beings. I just want everyone to win, that’s all I can say, and I think we can… . I think the words “dreamer” and “passionate” diminish my will to execute. Because to be passionate about something or to dream about something does not say that it was executed. So when we talk about second season, it was executed. When we went and had a great season with stores, with Barneys and Luisa Via Roma and all these amazing stores, that was executed. When those Yeezys came out and sold what they did, that was executed. You can have the longest intellectual artistic conversation about anything and it all means nothing without execution.

**The new collection will be available in stores and online?**

Yes, stores and online.

**And will the sneakers still be released as limited editions in phases?**

As we transition to eventually where I want to take the footwear, we’ll still keep limited colors for people who are involved in that culture. Because there is a level of exclusivity and stuff that is important in the sneaker culture, to get the ones that no one else has. But I’m sitting there and I’m looking at the 350s and I’m thinking about the Submariner Rolex or thinking about the Eames chair. It’s like how do you take this thing to a place where it’s just the classic shoe? I feel like the Air Force One or the shell toe speak to the ultimate version of what sneakers were 20 years ago. And I think there’s something about the 350s, that feeling of what sneakers are today. And I just want to keep going in there and working on the shape and the last and the way the knit feels, the padding, the colors, to hopefully make that shoe where 20 years from now people say the 350 represented what shoes were in 2016. And we’re doing the same thing for the 950s and the 750s. Like I keep saying, it’s not so much a design proposition as it is taking things that have a place in people’s heart, that people understand, and collaborating with amazing talents to improve on the concept. I love being in the factory. I love being in the factory more than I love being in a photograph, as I’m sure people know. I go to China four times a year. I want to be right there. I love when we say, O.K., we’re going to make six new shoes from these sketches, and I just can’t wait to get out of the hotel and get back to the factory and see if they’ve got them in, and two of them aren’t ready and they don’t come in till two P.M. You sit there and wait and then one of them sucks. That creative process, it’s like being at the Super Bowl … I think if Michelangelo was alive or Da Vinci was alive, there’s no way that they wouldn’t be working with shoes, as a part of what they work on. Definitely one of the things they’d work on would be shoes. I’ve gone three years without a phone. I don’t go a day without shoes.

**Any new designers impressing you?**

As far as the new designers go, everybody knows who’s everyone’s favorite. I told you. You remember, I was like this is the one, and that shit fucking blew up right. It’s like the No 1. Everyone’s waiting on it.

**You’re talking about Vetements. It’s true. You went to the showroom after their first collection and you showed me the pictures on your phone, before anyone was talking about it. And then their second collection just went boom.**

Pow. I sent [Vetements designer Demna Gvasalia] a text right before showing him one of the looks that Joe Mckenna did. And I just told him, this is my romance with the Gap. I picture the Gap in some way different than I think the rest of people picture it.

**It’s the ideal of the Gap, it’s the Gap 15 or 20 years ago.**

When it had the Peter Lindbergh photos… . I was so happy to just show so many sweatshirts. It’s as simple as that. I think sweatshirts are the way of the future. And we worked so hard on our development of our actual sweatshirts to make them fall a certain way, the dyeing that we do, the type of washing where we take a thicker Japanese stretch French terry and wash it down to where it keeps its original qualities but then feels so thin… . Sweatshirts are fucking important. That might sound like the funniest quote ever. How can you say all this stuff about running for president in 2020 and then say sweatshirts are important? But they are. Just mark my words. Mark my words like Mark Twain.

**In terms of the theaters and the live stream, why was that so important to you?**

So people can come together and connect with other people who care about it. If it’s just on the net, the most people you can get looking at one laptop is four people. But because we stream live to 40 locations, there are people who are going to 200-, 300-seat theaters with their friends. And eight friends will see 40 other people they know there. It draws everyone into Fashion Week. I completely see this becoming a trend, especially for mainstream brands like Givenchy, all the big boys. I can totally see them streaming their fashion shows to theaters, and it’ll be cool if I get the credit, like Dior, the original Christian Dior, gets the credit for putting music to runways.

**The Gap is a real obsession of yours.**

I say things like I want to be creative director for the Gap, but I just got to give credit to the people who do creative direction at the Gap. I’ve got to give super-props to Mickey Drexler. I know he’s not at the Gap anymore. That’s a talent. The same way [Azzedine] Alaia has a talent for what he does and he’s a master at it, and Nicolas Ghesquière is a master at what he does, Mickey Drexler is a master of that game. Just like [A.P.C. designer] Jean Touitou. This thing is just as important as the designer that can create something that’s more showy, to create something that feels invisible. That was one of the points for the collection today and one of the points I want to make in apparel, period. I want the clothes to almost go away, to almost be invisible, to be one with the personality. You know when you see people’s dogs look like them? I want people’s clothes to look like them.

**There was a controversy over the time slot for the show. Other designers made a stink about the fact that you came in late and took away that time slot.**

I totally apologize to any of those designers and anyone that wanted that slot. I would love to send them some flowers or maybe wear a sweatshirt if that could help to make up for it. A lot of times I feel like Will Ferrell in the movie Elf. You know this big guy that wants to [join in] and his hands are a little bit too big… . I could just say please forgive me if I ever step on any toes, because there’s nothing that I would ever want to do or say that would take away from any designer, that would take away from anyone’s work or what they’re working so hard on.

**Going back to your collaborative approach, one of the people you worked with on this collection was Katharine Hamnett [as reported in the Financial Times, the English designer opened up her archives for West].**

Yeah. There’s certain things where I’m like, am I supposed to say this in the press? Am I not supposed to say this? But I think that people in the fashion world knew that.

**You’ll work with anyone who has good ideas and you’re open about the collaborative nature of the process?**

I want to approach design and apparel in more of an Apple type way, and if Steve [Jobs] had been able to get my friend Drew [Houston] from Dropbox to handle the cloud, he would have. He wouldn’t have had a problem saying, Oh, I hired Drew from Dropbox to handle the cloud. I’d like to work with everybody. I like to work with everybody in design.

**You seem very calm right now. Is it fair to say you’re in a different mind frame in general these days?**

It’s like if you’re swimming through the ocean for 10 years, 12 years, 13 years of your life, and now with this collection, I feel like I see sand. I can see the beach. That’s just inspiring. At a certain point if you’re swimming so long and you just can’t see any return on the amount of work that you put into it, it makes you want to give up. It makes you want to question yourself, and I question myself all the time. I’ll see like the new Gucci collection or stuff or Vetements or Givenchy and I’ll be like, Man, what the fuck? This is so past anything...

**Then you’ve got to keep swimming. Is the album still called Swish?**

It’s currently called Swish. I’m forgetting even what the last name of it was now.
