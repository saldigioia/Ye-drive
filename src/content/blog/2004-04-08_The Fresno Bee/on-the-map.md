# On the Map

## Entrepreneurs' Designs Make Visalia a Hip-Hop Household Word.

When the mail came last Wednesday, Sam Hansen received something extra with the package of CDs he was expecting.

It was a folded-up piece of binder paper with a hand-drawn sketch by rapper/ producer Kanye West.

He wanted his drawing on a T-shirt. And when Kanye West wants T-shirts made, he turns not to a major designer, but to Hansen and Bobby Naugle, the co-owners of Visalia hip-hop store FTK, short for "For The Kids."

Two days after getting the sketch, Hansen sat down at his computer in the back of his shop, opened up Adobe Illustrator and went to work. Ten minutes later, he had a rough design done.

It read, "The College Dropout," the name of West's chart-topping debut album.

West's logo, a bear's head looking at the ground, was in place of the "o" in "college." It looked, as West had requested, like a logo for a sports team.

That bear — known as the Dropout Bear - is plastered across West's platinumselling CD and a set of T-shirts for sale inside the CD booklet.

The logo and those T-shirts both are the work of FIK, too.

Listen to "The College Dropout," and it's obvious where Kanye West is fromChicago. He shouts out his city often. But his merchandise comes from a place that not many would expect — Visalia.

FTK is the official merchandiser for West. The store has designed and marketed three different T-shirts for West, including a tour shirt that went on sale last weekend, and estimates it will sell 10,000 shirts by the time the rapper's national School Spirit tour winds down in early May.

Read the credits in West's CD, and you'll see "Dropout Bear logo design: Bobby Naugle and Sam Hansen for FTK."

Go to www.kanyewest.com, click on "shop," and you'll be redirected to www. ftkonline.com, where the five different varieties of the original "College Dropout" shirts are available as well as West CDs. Go to a live show, walk up to the merchandise table at any of the tour stops, and you'll see Naugle working behind the table selling shirts, up to 300 per night.

West is the artist of the moment in hip-hop and rhythm and blues.

As a producer, his credits are vast, including Jay-Z's "Izzo" and " '03 Bonny and Clyde," Ludacris' "Stand Up," Alicia Keys' "You Don't Know My Name" and most recently Janet Jackson's "I Want You."

As an emcee, his album, "The College Dropout" has been near the top of the charts since its February release, and he's been widely considered an artist who can bridge the gap between mainstream and underground hip-hop, with such songs as "All Falls Down," "Through the Wire" and "Slow Jamz."

"It's already given us a huge amount of credibility," Naugle says from his hotel room in Los Angeles before that night's show at the House of Blues. "People in the industry, the people that for whatever reason might not have taken us seriously, it made them say "Wow.'" 

It seems logical that the Naugle and Hansen hooked up with West.

All of them decided to circumvent the regular college route and chase their dreams. 

For West, it was music. For Naugle and Hansen, both 25, it was a hip-hop store.

FTK opened in November V 2001, founded on ambition by b two guys who had only taken a b few college classes. 

The store started with a Web site, www.centralcali.com, in 2000. Its niche initially was selling music and clothes for independent hip-hop fans and skaters. That expanded into throwing hip-hop events around the central San Joaquin Valley that drew people from all over the state.

Now FTK is drawing orders worldwide.

The FTK-Kanye West relationship started when Naugle was put in touch with West's manager by a loyal FTK customer in Chicago. Naugle already had been a fan of West, who at the time was best known as one of Jay-Z's producers and a budding rapper.

FTK began carrying West's mixtapes. Soon, Naugle had put together a proposal for West's management: He wanted FTK to produce Kanye West shirts.

The idea went over well, and last fall Naugle and Hansen designed and printed a batch of shirts. As West's album was close to being released, Naugle had a proposal for shirts to go along with the album. Meanwhile, Hansen, a graphic designer by trade, began to work on various logos and designs.

"A lot of midnight oil was burned on Kanye," Hansen says. "I don't know that he would have gotten that type of treatment anywhere else."

When the album hit stores, shirt orders were stacking up. Phone and e-mail orders were coming more quickly than they could be filled.

"It's out of control. Our e-mail is flooded," says Danny Hernandez, 23, one of the two new employees at FTK since the Kanye craze.

Shirts have been sent across the country and around the world, from Omaha, Neb., to Osaka, Japan, Hansen says. And while orders have died down a bit now that the album has been on shelves for awhile, FTK still sells a couple hundred shirts per week from its site.

With that, the presence of the store has broadened considerably, locally and elsewhere.

"It's brought appeal to a more commercial market while at the same time keeping our true school hip-hop integrity," Hansen says. "Anyone who knows anything about real hip-hop in central California already shops at FTK. So it's bringing us more customers from more markets. They come to the store for the Kanye West stuff, and they see all the other things that we carry."

A few months back, with a national tour on the horizon, Naugle again had a proposal for West's management: FTK would make tour shirts, and Naugle would go on the tour and handle all the merchandise.

Management went for that, too.

"He showed and proved his value," says Don C., one of West's managers. "Rolling with him, it definitely gives us a little more hands-on with our products over a big merchanding company."

The result was two months on the road for Naugle, a bunk on the tour bus and even more contacts. He could go back on the road with West in the summer.

"One of the reasons he's with us," Naugle says, "is the relationship we had with his management early. We weren't trying to jump on the bandwagon. It would be harder to come at him now."

Now, Hansen and Naugle are branching out further.

In the two months since "The College Dropout" came out, FTK has built similar relationships with Young Gunz and Just Blaze, who, like West, are Rocafella Records artists.

Also, FTK has begun work on products for producer Alchemist and Fresno rapper Planet Asia. For the Philadelphia-based Young Gunz, Hansen received a logo and did a simple design to promote their album "Tough Luv."

But he also stayed up until 4 a.m. designing 10 other shirts that were more ambitious. One used a heart with a crack in it like the Liberty Bell to go along with "Tough Luv."

Another was a takeoff on the Philadelphia Flyers hockey logo.

That was the design Kanye West saw, prompting him to sketch a psuedo sports logo and send it to Hansen.

While Hansen sits in front of his computer, playing with Adobe Illustrator for artists like West or Young Gunz, Naugle is somewhere across the country, trying to build more relationships.

At every tour stop, Naugle is meeting new artists, handing out business cards and trying to recruit more clients. Recently he met rapper Common and hopes to work with him.

Usually impressed by his products, people ask who he is and where he's from.

He says he's from FTK in Visalia.

Visalia? That's the usual response.

"If they don't know, I say it's near Fresno," Naugle says. "They get the idea, but I definitely always make sure I say Visalia. Trying to make it a household name still."
