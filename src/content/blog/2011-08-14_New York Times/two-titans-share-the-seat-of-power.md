# Two Titans Share the Seat of Power

Events in hip-hop feel smaller than they used to. This is the age of the regional hit, the no-budget viral video, the Twitter star. Hip-hop, so long the most vibrant force in pop music, could always be counted on for big spending, a boon to producers, directors, fashion stylists, car dealers and so on, to say nothing of the marketing specialists, brand synergists and secondary industries it fueled. But in recent years the center has been weakening, and the genre is readjusting to life built from the bottom up.

Jay-Z and Kanye West are from-the-top-down guys, though: old-fashioned oligarchs, the last of a dying breed. There are younger stars who have their sort of dominance on their mind — Lil Wayne and Drake primarily — but the landscape they have to navigate doesn’t favor the lengthy reigns of old, especially when the entrenched powers refuse to cede any ground.

Still, by all measurements, 2011 is perhaps the worst time for Jay-Z and Mr. West to release their first collaborative album, “Watch the Throne” (Roc-a-Fella/Def Jam/Roc Nation). This is an album that announces its importance well before it appears, a team-up of titans not given to sharing the spotlight. From a distance it’s a final burst of hip-hop hubris, the last gasp of the late-1990s to mid-‘00s insistence on hugeness, a Howitzer at the door.

But up close “Watch the Throne” is none of those things. It forsakes the epic for the idiosyncratic, it tempers its bombast with both reflection and inventiveness. It’s not the Brobdingnagian affair it could have been, and is better for it. Restraint isn’t quite the word; this is a full, complex and not shy record. Instead, what’s on display is curiosity and risk.

Curiosity and risk are often byproducts of privilege, of course, and many of the aesthetic choices on “Watch the Throne” derive directly from the circumstances of its creation. The songs were developed in three bursts across several months and continents, creating a range of moods and tones. As a whole it’s not totally legible; there are too many ideas, as if Jay-Z and Mr. West (billed as the Throne for this project) were auditioning several new styles but forgot to choose one. But “Watch the Throne” is an album with several phenomenal moments, even if it doesn’t quite add up to a phenomenal album.

In this union the unflappable Jay-Z has given in ever so slightly to the restless Mr. West. Both sound hungry and probing and, most important, not complacent, making “Watch the Throne” perhaps the most ambitious and effortful late-career album hip-hop has ever seen. This is the least obviously commercial album Mr. West has ever made; as for Jay-Z it rivals some of his recent artistic disappointments, failures of shortsightedness, not ambition.

Jay-Z, 41, and Mr. West, 34, have appeared on several songs together in recent years, but their most intimate collaboration remains Jay-Z’s 2001 album “The Blueprint,” for which Mr. West, then just a producer, contributed four songs. In the years since, they’ve developed a reliable mentor-student relationship: Jay-Z carves out new territory for a rapper, then Mr. West tests its boundaries, often breaking through them. Still, when they rap together, Mr. West often willingly plays the junior member of the partnership, while Jay-Z is reluctant to sacrifice even an inch of his authority, even as Mr. West has become a peer and maybe more.

For all the ego involved, “Watch the Throne” is shockingly amiable. There’s no competition on display. It reveals less about the relationship between Mr. West and Jay-Z than the minor disagreements that popped up in the press in the weeks before this album’s release. They may not always see eye to eye, but “Watch the Throne” almost never suggests they have incompatible agendas.

They’re simpatico right down to the fine points. Several tracks feature the two rapping back and forth, EPMD style, a true duo. The closer, “Why I Love You,” plays as an update of “Coming of Age,” the hustler education lesson from Jay-Z’s 1996 debut, “Reasonable Doubt.” Replacing the naif Memphis Bleek, though, there’s Mr. West, not just a protege but a partner, sympathizing with Jay-Z as he laments how his old students failed to hold the fort.

Jay-Z has always been a good leader if not a great manager. He’s sharper in company he deems worthy. If he frets about anything on this album, it’s the increasingly rarefied air he breathes, and the particular stresses that come with occupying those spaces as a black man. “Why all the pretty icons always all white?” he asks on “That’s My Bitch.” “Put some colored girls in the MoMA.” On “Murder to Excellence” he’s more blunt: “Only spot a few blacks the higher I go/What’s up to Will, shout-out to O.” And to Mr. West as well, who responds tartly: “We like the promised land of the O.G.’s/In the past if you picture events like a black tie/What’s the last thing you expect to see? Black guys.”

But Mr. West and Jay-Z have transcended all that, necessitating a hip-hop category beyond street money, beyond new money. They’re quick absorbers and have been quickly assimilated, Mr. West more so, thanks to the trail Jay-Z left for him. The signifiers aren’t jewelry and cars — though Jay-Z raps about his Hublot watch and Mr. West talks about his “1985 white Lamborghini Countach/Two of ‘em” — but high fashion and high art.

“Basquiats, Warhols serving as my muses/My house like a museum,” Jay-Z raps on a bonus track. “Usually you have this much taste, you European/That’s the end of that way of thinking.” (Mr. West, as usual, gets to the point more quickly: “What’s that jacket — Margiela?”)

For Jay-Z breaking these old barriers is a means to acceptance and stability. It’s as if he were building a home in a new neighborhood and doesn’t want his credentials doubted. By contrast Mr. West sounds lonely; fame hasn’t done much but place him in a wolves’ den. “Sunglasses and Advil/Last night was mad real,” he mopes on “No Church in the Wild.” For Mr. West every flash of Dionysian extreme is tempered by the realization of its hollowness. “In the mirror where I see my only enemy,” he raps on “The Joy,” “Your life’s cursed?/Well, mine’s an obscenity.”

Most of Jay-Z’s pain here is deeply ingrained. On “Welcome to the Jungle” he details the family deaths that nearly undid him. On “The Joy” he laments, “I seen so much as a kid, they surprised I don’t needle pop.”

Both rappers have effectively mined the darker corners of their biographies for great music before, but it’s stirring to hear them do side by side. The first half of “Murder to Excellence” is among the most explicitly political music either has made. Most vivid is “New Day,” the album’s melancholy center, with both men addressing their unborn children. Here, as elsewhere, Jay-Z is taut. Mr. West is expansive:

I’ll never let my son have an ego

He’ll be nice to everyone wherever we go

I mean, I might even make him be Republican

So everybody know he love white people

Making relevant socially themed songs in an age of financial and political unrest is a challenge these two artists at least pay lip service to. Like a charitable donation, it’s a combination of maturity and duty. But the real tests on “Watch the Throne” are musical, not conceptual. The scattered nature of this album’s creation is evident most in the production, which can be roughly segmented into three categories. There are the Southern-inflected tracks, which are the most obvious concessions to modern hit making, and which are curiously few here: just “HAM,” produced by Lex Luger, and two of the album’s highlights, both with unprintable titles, produced by Hit-Boy and Southside. (Mr. West also receives production credit on almost every song.)

There are the moody and harsh numbers like the dubstep-influenced “Who Gon Stop Me,” and the TV on the Radio-esque “Why I Love You.” And then there’s the nostalgia that creeps over much of this album, giving it a sonic through-line and mission statement. On the gloomy “New Day,” produced with the RZA, both men borrow the “me and the RZA connect” line from Raekwon’s 1995 connoisseur classic “Incarcerated Scarfaces.” “Otis” is built, rather straightforwardly, around a sample of Otis Redding’s “Try a Little Tenderness,” and “The Joy,” a bonus track, relies heavily on Curtis Mayfield’s “Making of You (Live).” The No I.D.-produced “Primetime” has the scratchiness of the mid-‘90s, and the loose and frenzied “That’s My Bitch” moves with the swagger of an old Diamond D production, with Mr. West evoking Slick Rick and Jay-Z Chubb Rock.

On a technical level Jay-Z hasn’t pushed himself this much in years. In places he’s too reliant on the stop-start flow he’s honed of late, but mostly he’s digging around in the corner of his toolbox, looking for underused patterns and cadences to revive.

That’s a victory for art on an album whose success will be determined, at least initially, by its size. “Watch the Throne” was released on iTunes on Monday, and will be released on CD in Best Buy on Friday, arriving in other stores later this month, the better to stem any financial losses from piracy, and also an attempt to consolidate the reception of the album.

This is an old-guard way of addressing new times, hoping to impose order on an environment that is intrinsically fractured. But that’s consistent with how Mr. West and Jay-Z approached the making of this album, large chunks of which were actually recorded in hotels, which are then often rapped about. (Maybe the Mercer Hotel and the Tribeca Grand will offer “Watch the Throne” suites for hip-hop tourists.)

There’s no sense of place on “Watch the Throne” beyond a global here and now. The two men travel across time zones and locations, and squeeze out bursts of creativity before toweling off and making for the next spot. The album artwork is by Riccardo Tisci, the Givenchy designer, but there are references in the lyrics to YC’s “Racks” and Waka Flocka Flame’s “Bustin at Em,” recent Atlanta rap anthems. Even some of the sample choices — recent tracks by the house music veterans Cassius and the dubstep comer Flux Pavilion — are songs probably heard overseas and quickly tweaked for the purposes of “Watch the Throne,” but it also features Frank Ocean, the rising R&B star. The foreign lives alongside the familiar.

Furthermore, a close reading of the liner notes reveals gems: impossible-to-notice vocals by Seal (why?) on “Lift Off,” snippets from the Will Ferrell ice skating comedy “Blades of Glory,” freelance opera singers, a moving sample from the Indiggo Twins, “America’s Got Talent” punching bags and, as described here, “ambassadors of the great Romanian tradition” (which?).

This isn’t excess for excess’s sake. It’s the state of being so rich you forgot where you put all your nice things, being so rich you lost sight of which stuff is actually nice and which stuff you bought just because you’re used to buying things. Meaningful references — the abundant James Brown samples, the use of Redding and Mayfield — are all jumbled with irrelevant ones.

But that confusion is a sort of victory here. Instead of a monolithic mandate delivered from on high, “Watch the Throne” delivers something more splintered and haphazard, a legitimate engagement with what it means to be new, in the now. It’s a small record by big men with nothing to lose but bigness itself.
