# West, Ego Entertain Saskatoon

The biggest question Tuesday night when Kanye West took the stage at Credit Union Centre in Saskatoon was whether the event could live up to his infamous ego. On a stage big enough to match his larger-than-life personality, he answered very loudly. The rapper delivered a visual spectacle that made the hype seem warranted. 

The show, part of his Glow in the Dark tour, had West crashing into a mysterious planet an elaborately sloped stage with giant screens with no one to talk to but his spaceship, Jane. Instead of shouting “How are you doing Saskatoon?’ like so many acts do, West ignored audience interaction and instead turned the concert into a kind of performance piece. He performed songs including Heard ‘em Say, Through the Wire, Diamonds From Sierra Leone, All Falls Down and the infinitely crowd-pleasing Gold Digger. 

The trippy, otherworldly onstage environment featured an expansive starry sky, blue and red flames and rolling smoke that looked like clouds. West confidently took the massive stage alone, knowing the crowd would eat up his every word. But he also had the humour to make fun of his well-known arrogance. (A group of shooting stars in the Glow in the Dark galaxy say, “Of course, we know who you are.

You’re the biggest star in the universe.” It’s purely tongue-in-cheek ... or is it?) Later, before performing Jesus Walks, he promises to “stop spazzing out at awards shows.” His ego, whether it is real or manufactured, is something fans had no problem validating with their enthusiasm. 

West’s smart, savvy lyrics eschew hip-hop stereotypes. There is no denying his talent and the seriousness with which he takes his music. Though entertaining, the show lost something without an effort on West’s part to step out of the script and talk to fans directly.

West made sure to include a tribute to his mother, who died last year, with the emotional tribute Hey Mama But even when not talking about a lost loved one. West oozes passion. He might have an ego, or maybe it’s just that he practices his craft with a kind of perfectionism not understood by just anyone.

One of the show’s highlights was West’s performance of his recent smash hit Stronger, which uses a brilliant sample from Daft Punk. West clearly wants his fans to be entertained and takes great pride in every cheer and hand in the air. Cocky or not, West’s Glow in the Dark tour delivered more than just a hip-hop show; it was an intergalactic journey through a complicated man’s complicated mind. 

West shared his show with three acts that can hardly be called openers. Lupe Fiasco, N.E.R.D. and Rihanna would have drawn big crowds without the allure of the headliner. Fiasco (born Wasalu Muhammad Jaco) started off the Glow in the Dark evening. Despite his bedazzled, red leather ensemble and dark sunglasses, the 25-year-old rapper from Chicago gave the impression success isn’t something he takes for granted. In his hit song, Superstar, he raps, “I want to believe the hypebut it’s too untrue,” and goes on to make fun of the trappings of fame rather than exalting them. Fiasco was backed by three talented singers: Nikki Jean, Sarah Green and Matthew Santos, whose voice could easily be mistaken for Adam Levine of Maroon 5. Fiasco’s short and sweet set was infused with tons of energy, passion and just the right amount of swagger.

N.E.R.D., made up of Pharrell Williams, Chad Hugo and Shay Haley, played for the wall-to-wall crowd next The trio, backed by a full band, packed the sliver of stage not taken up by West’s equipment with people eager to dance and, as their song demands, spaz. Joining them at one point was a man who looked suspiciously like rumoured Rihanna beau, and fellow pop star, Chris Brown, crumped and flipped on stage. The set, peppered with their hits including Lapdance, Rock Star and their latest, Everybody Nose showed off their alternative, funk, hip-hop style and obvious sense of fun with entertaining results. Williams, who has produced songs for everyone from Snoop Dogg to Britney Spears, stole the show with his dance moves and interaction with the audience.

While the setup between acts made the show drag a bit, diehard fans seemed happy to use the time to mingle, use the washroom and buy pairs of West’s now-ubiquitous white plastic glasses.

Barbados-born beauty Rihanna was the last act to precede West. Dressed in an outfit that can only be described as high-fashion-dominatrix-superhero, she launched into the song Breakin’ Dishes. Flanked by four futuristically dressed backup dancers and two singers, she proved that the voice you hear on the radio is the same one she brings to the live environment. She pleased the audience with plenty of hits from her short career, including Pon de Replay, SOS, Don’t Stop the Music, Umbrella and Take a Bow. While her voice sounds beautiful, the manicured and choreographed set seemed a bit out of place amid the other opening acts. sclassensp.canwest.com.
