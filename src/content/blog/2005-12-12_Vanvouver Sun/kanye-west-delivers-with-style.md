# Kanye West Delivers With Style

## Hip-Hop Superstar Has All the Right Moves and His High-Energy Show Proves to Be Irresistable

Much, perhaps too much, has been made recently of the apparent beef between rappers 50 Cent and Kanye West, with the former claiming, among other things, that his brutal, often violent lyrics and style created a backlash that allowed West’s conscious hip-hop to rise to the top of the charts.

While it could certainly be argued that Fifty, along with countless other purveyors of thug rap, made audiences long for more peaceful, positive lyrical content, to say that West has sold millions of records just by being at the right place at the right time is ludicrous. Because, as anyone who attended West’s show last night at GM Place can attest, the man is a verifiable star.

Uplifting opener Touch the Sky set the tone for an exuberant evening, with West’s endlessly alluring mix of bravado, fierce intellect, wit, and most fascinatingly, gaping self-doubt apparent from the first note.

While the handsome young rapper was decked out in a spotless white suit and shades that probably cost more than some people’s houses, the mood was more church revival than ghetto-fab. The audience, decked to the nines, was treated to a full-scale Kanye pageant, complete with play staging, a string orchestra and a cohesive narrative throughout the show. While crowd were likely already familiar with West’s biography — a rather unglamorous rise from lower-middle class upbringing, stints working at the GAP, a shot at a rap career nearly thwarted by a life-threatening accident - - West, preaching his story the way a reverend does his own gospel, used somewhat hokey skits to sew the show together.

From a version of Drive Slow delivered in GAP employee uniforms to a could-be-naff-but-actually-touching-rendition of Roses (an ode to West’s Grandmother which takes more than a few vicious shots at American-style health care), West made sure his show was a multi- media experience for his adoring fans.

With crowd-pleasers like Heard ‘Em Say, from this year’s triumphant must-buy, Late Registration, and Workout Plan, from West’s all-conquering debut, the mood was less political and more party-starting, with West dancing on stage like a seasoned vet.

Ever the perfectionist, it was apparent from watching the slick- moved star that he is a man very much intent on pleasing his audience. Running from one end of the stage to the other, peering madly to see if the crowd was dancing, West was a whirl of contradictions; announcing his 8 Grammy noms, demanding love from the audience, but at the same time, remaining affably humble in a way that similarly pop-oriented rap stars — paging P. Diddy — have been unable to do.

It is West’s ability to deftly walk, or rather, dance, the line between self-important hero and voice of the people that makes him so irresistibly likeable.

For every song where it seemed he might cross the line into rap- cliche (the scolding hit Gold Digger) he made up for it with a whip- smart lyric, witty jibe at himself, or, best yet, a flash of his mega-watt grin.

While it seemed the affluent crowd may have missed some of the finer points of West’s lyrics (the scathing criticisms of the U.S. administration got no cheers), it hardly mattered. The kids who love Kanye for his addictive hooks enjoyed the show every bit as much as the politically savvy fans who have been suckered in by West’s willingness to call a space a spade. In the end, everyone who went West, young man, regardless of the reason was pleased with their final destination.
