# Kanye West Fails to Pay Lapdancers

Rapper Kanye West has reportedly earned the wrath of the owner of a prominent London lapdancing club.

The Grammy award winner left the owner furious when he didn’t pay the bill after enjoying the company of the club’s lapdancers.

The hip-hop star enjoyed six lapdances at Stringfellows last week, but didn’t respect his side of the deal after failing to pay for the service.

“If the bling round his neck had fallen off, it could have paid for holidays for all of my girls,” Contactmusic quoted club owner Peter Stringfellow, as saying.

Meanwhile West insists that Justin Timberlake is the only singer in the music industry who is as good as he is.

West admitted that he considered Timberlake to be his biggest competitor.

“My biggest competition is Justin Timberlake. He’s the only other person that gets an across-the-board response and respect level,” he told the Mirror.
