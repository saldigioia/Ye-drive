# Kanye's 'Fantasy' Contains a Beautiful Reality

## A Deeply Personal, Genre-Bending Blast of Genius

Kanye West is arguably popular music's most compelling and controversial figure. In the past six years, he's been acclaimed for four groundbreaking albums and disdained for his public fits of pique and rampant narcissism. The audacious new My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (**** out of four) opens a window into an ego that is often tripping, thus exposing the insecurities and foibles that fuel West's boundless creativity and grandiose ambitions.

West threw himself into his music during a self-imposed exile from the spotlight after his embarrassing Taylor Swift moment at MTV's 2009 Video Music Awards. He stayed in the studio, working through personal issues and pouring those feelings into songs. Though he's rooted in a genre where rappers shield their emotions, West succeeds by doing the opposite. The result is an epic, adventurous aural melange that easily outstrips anything he's done.

"I just needed time alone, with my thoughts," he says on Power. "Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault."

He not only gets the treasures out, he shapes them into sonic jewels that sparkle with contributions from pop's and hip-hop's glitterati. The anthemic All of the Lights alone features a dozen stars, including Rihanna, Alicia Keys, The-Dream, Kid Cudi, Fergie and Elton John.

With the help of such producers as The RZA, Bink!, No ID, Mike Dean and Jeff Bhasker, West unleashes an array of sonic flavors -- old school hip-hop, progressive rock, R&B, classical music -- and deftly mixes and matches them.

On the wrenching Runaway (basis for a 30-minute West-directed short film released in October), he confesses to his problems sustaining relationships: "Never was much of a romantic/I could never take the intimacy/And I know it did damage/Cus the look in your eyes is killin' me."

Still, he's hardly throwing a self-pity party. On the escalating ego arms race that is Monster -- with Jay-Z, Rick Ross, Nicki Minaj and Bon Iver -- West declares, "my presence is a present." His piece de resistance, though, is Blame Game, a brooding, nearly eight-minute tale of a couple with irreconcilable differences that plays out with growing hostility over John Legend's moody piano work.

With the success he's had, West could settle into a predictable hitmaking rut. Instead, the only thing predictable about him is his unremitting drive to make his next project better than his last.
