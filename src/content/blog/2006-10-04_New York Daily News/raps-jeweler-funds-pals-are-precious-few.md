# Rap's Jeweler Funds Pals Are Precious Few

Is Jacob the Jeweler in so much trouble that his hip-hop customers are running away from him?

Maybe not, but Vanity Fair's Nancy Jo Sales reports that 21 hip- hop artists - "many of whom have rapped about Jacob, in more than 40 songs" - declined to offer words of support for federal money- laundering defendant Jacob Arabov, who maintains his innocence.

Chief among the no-shows is Kanye West, who rapped in his 2005 tune "Touch the Sky": "I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance/ I just wanted to shine." Sales writes: "West, who briefly considered doing a line of sneakers with Jacob, passed on commenting for this story."

Still, a couple of A-listers - Sean Combs and Busta Rhymes - were eager to say nice things about the 41-year-old Arabov, who was arrested in June and charged with laundering stacks of cash for the Detroit-based alleged drug-dealing gang known as the Black Mafia Family.

B.M.F., which calls itself an entertainment company, "is responsible for numerous acts of violence, including the [2003] murder of Sean (Puffy) Combs' bodyguard Anthony (Wolf) Jones," according to a New York Police Department report.

But Combs told Sales: "It's hard not to become friendly with Jacob. He's a cool cat."

Rhymes - who, like Combs, has had his own brushes with the law - said: "He's an incredible salesman. He knows how to charm the s- out of his clients and treat them with respect."

The "King of Bling," who arrived in the U.S. from Uzbekistan at age 14 and became a millionaire celebrity, faces up to 20 years in prison. But Rhymes says the charges are "a bunch of bulls-. Anybody that affiliates themselves with people that are from the street, they always go the extra mile to investigate them. At the end of the day, why would Jacob come this far, purchasing a $12 million building on 57th St. - why would he do anything illegally?"

COUNTING ON THE BIG SCORE-SES

Never mind Academy Awards and critical raves. Martin Scorsese's (above) "The Departed" is all about cold cash.

"We're going for commerciality on this one," producer Graham King told Lowdown. "Pure commerce. And if anything comes along with it, great. If it doesn't, that's fine, too."

King hesitated when asked to predict this weekend's opening box office, but finally let slip: "I hope it's more than $30 [million], and anything above $40 [million] I'll be very happy."

Asked how low the number must go before he cries, King laughed and answered: "Twenty-five. It might take a bit of word of mouth. We'll see; I mean with this cast? Everyone should go, right?"

The Oscarless Scorsese directed the movie - which cost Warner Bros. a reported $90 million to make and stars Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg, among other big- name actors.

King, who's produced three of Scorsese's films, said: "It's hard to have a favorite. Obviously 'The Aviator' was very dear to my heart. I love 'Gangs [of New York].' But this is different in a way that it is commerce. I think kids on a Friday night will go out and see this movie and will enjoy it."

QUICK & DIRTY.

NO BILL FOR BILL?

It was mother-daughter bonding in the Meatpacking District when Hillary and Chelsea Clinton (right) popped into resort-wear purveyor Calypso over the weekend. A Lowdown spy spotted New York's junior senator, accompanied by two bodyguards, waiting as her daughter tried things on. "They both looked better than I'd expected," says the spy, but "Hillary was wearing a stank bright-pink coat and black pants." And despite the fashion needs of the once and possibly future White House occupant, the pair left empty-handed after a fruitless 15 minutes.

WE'LL SMOKE TO THAT!

"Flags of our Fathers" star Ryan Phillippe jumped up and down, yelled and pumped his fists in the air when wife Reese Witherspoon won a Golden Globe back in January, and now we know why. "At the Golden Globes I was plastered!" Phillippe tells Rolling Stone magazine. "Shirley MacLaine and I drank like crazy, just putting away bottles of wine and making fun of everyone." The father of two goes on: "The ultimate 20-year plan is to be living in the Caribbean, writing, living off the land, eating from the ocean and probably smoking herb."

SNARK ATTACK !

It's hardly a surprise that Anna Nicole Smith's former friends aren't happy about her recent "commitment ceremony" to ambitious lawyer Howard K. Stern. Anna's former manager, Eric Redding, tells Star magazine: "Howard is not the nicest person in the world. He seems very controlling. I think he's in it for the settlement." Interior decorator Bobby Trendy, Anna's ex-confidante, claimed: "I don't know any woman who let that man's private parts near her - even if they were unattached to his body!" Ouch.
