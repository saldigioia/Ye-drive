# A Brand-New Year

The concept behind the clothes was simple: head-to-toe ensembles that riff on a single color. “It’s not about having a lot of clothes,” West says. “It’s about a few favorites.” For more of Kanye’s current take on style, read on.

Kanye west has been married for ten days, and he has that new-husband way with the ring still, pulling it on and off like it’s something he might yet undo, or do again. The ring is gold, and understated in a way that not much else about Kanye West is. He sits in the lobby of New York’s Mercer Hotel — the same hotel where he and Jay Z recorded most of Watch the Throne — reflecting on the distance he’s come. “I am a black American male from Chicago,” West says, “who had my rehearsal dinner at Versailles and then got married in Florence with a view of the entire city.”

He is one year removed from Yeezus, the record that took all of West’s prodigious pop gifts and made a show of immolating them one by one. He is one year removed from telling anyone who’d listen that he was going to burn the entire fashion industry down, or at least he would once they let him through the door. Now they kind of have: He’s got a capsule collection with A.P.C. out now; a line with Adidas that debuts with footwear this fall; and somewhere off in the distance, a new menswear line. He’s also got a new record — maybe even a full-on pop record, though he hasn’t decided yet. He knows he is no longer the most popular man in rap. “Currently that spot is taken,” West says. “Let’s be honest — he got last summer.”

**Who?**

“You know. There’s only one person.”

**Drake?**

“Yeah. He got last summer. And I’d never given it up till last summer.” Now he’s thinking about taking it back. “It’s a real question for me. Do I want to?”

Meanwhile, he’s reckoning with what it is to be a father and a husband, and a decent human. He’s happier now — “You see I haven’t name-dropped and said a bunch of negative stuff about people,” he says at one point — but no less homicidally competitive or less convinced that he’s the next Steve Jobs. He’d like to spend more time with his family. He’d also still like to build amusement parks. It’s a contradiction, one he’s only begun to resolve. And all the while, he can’t go outside with his wife, Kim Kardashian, without having his photo taken. His entire waking life has become a performance, a manifesto, a fashion shoot.

Most of the time, he’s cool with that fact. But not always. “I hope we don’t see no paparazzi today,” West says. “Because I’m still getting acquainted with these jogging pants I threw on. Like, ‘That’s not my statement!’”

**You got married a week ago. You’re the lead subject in practically every tabloid on the planet right now. Are you comfortable in that position, having that many eyes on you?**

That wasn’t my goal. My goal is just to be respected as a man when I walk down the street with my family. I don’t care what your job is, you’re not gonna talk down to me, you’re not gonna try to get a rise out of me. I’m a man first. And in establishing that, some interesting things have happened. [laughs]

**Like that TMZ video from last year, where you’re walking with your pregnant fiancee with your head down to avoid the paparazzi, to the point where you walked into a sign and hit your head. Then TMZ made fun of you for walking into the sign. How do you live like that?**

It’s definitely a cult. And then put on top of that the idea of going and taking meetings with people, and people say, “We don’t want to work with you, because we saw you get mad about running into the sign.”

**Does that kind of mockery feel like an effort to de-fang you?**

But also, there’s no fangs. I don’t have fangs. I’m a porcupine. I’m a blowfish. Like, I’m a — what’s the fish that blows up?

**A blowfish?**

Yeah. I’m a blowfish. I’m not a shark, I’m a blowfish. So that perfect example about me hitting my head, it’s like a blowfish. I wasn’t coming out of my house going to a paparazzi’s house to attack them. I’m defending my family in front of my own house. I’m defending my name as someone’s screaming something negative at me. That’s a blowfish. People have me pinned as a shark or a predator in some way, and in no way am I that. I wouldn’t want to hurt anyone. I want to defend people. I want to help people.

**STEP ONE: THINK ECLECTIC**

“Skinny pants are rock ’n’ roll. And big coats are really hip-hop. I’m looking for 50 percent rock ’n’ roll, 50 percent hip-hop, 50 percent genius,” West says, laughing. “Because, you know — for genius, you have to be at a hundred and fifty percent.”

## Step Two: Turn Down the Contrast

“Most clothes are black or white. But I don’t like all that contrast. It looks either too work, too waiter, or too wedding-y to me. If that’s even a word, wedding-y. Anyway, that’s why I like tonal. There’s less contrast; it’s more casual.”

“You can’t win every single fight. It’s a long war, and if you’re out there trying to blow up every single building, you won’t win the war.”

## Step Three: Balance Form and Function

“If you’re wearing layers, you can be in L.A., New York, Paris, in an airport lounge, or on a plane, taking layers on and off however. And the proportions get emotional. You know how a graphic can express a feeling or an emotion? Layers can, too.”

“Even as I was put higher in the class system for being this musician, I never lost my dinosaur.”

**Can I read you something? The New York Post’s Page Six has an account of your wedding that reads, in part: “Kanye returned one hour before the wedding and didn’t like the all-white bar that was in front of the Gold Toilet Tower. He took a saw and started sawing it in half himself” — **

For the person that wrote that, were they involved with anything last year that was as culturally significant as the Yeezus tour or that album? They didn’t even talk there about the photographs, or the dress, or Andrea Bocelli singing, or the marble tables. They’re like: “It’s a gold toilet.” No. The bathrooms — that usually would be a porta-potty — were wrapped in a fabric that was neutral to match the fort. The bar was terrible, and the wedding planner didn’t approve it with me. I was having issues with this wedding planner the entire time on approvals, and I get there and they threw some weird plastic bar there. So the same materials that were used to cover the bathroom, we said, “Let’s just use that, because this is all we have to make the bar look better.” Which it did, in the end. And anyone knows that you cannot pick up tools yourself, because of — what are those rules about the workers?

**Unions?**

Yeah, unions. You can’t do that. It’s illegal. That’s false.

**Then they say you gave a forty-five-minute toast to yourself.**

And what I talked about in it was the idea of celebrity, and celebrities being treated like blacks were in the ‘60s, having no rights, and the fact that people can slander your name. I said that in the toast. And I had to say this in a position where I, from the art world, am marrying Kim. And how we’re going to fight to raise the respect level for celebrities so that my daughter can live a more normal life. She didn’t choose to be a celebrity. But she is. So I’m going to fight to make sure she has a better life.

**How does it feel when you read something like that account of your wedding or you see a photo of you looking glum at a zipline go viral?**

My feelings don’t matter anymore.

**Of course they do. You should be able to be a human with feelings, too.**

That’s fine. But that’s not the case, is it?

**Is that the way you feel, that you’re always in the ring?**

Yeah. I’m sitting right here, it’s a fight. I’m fighting with the way I line my words up together and the way I place a sweater on top of a T-shirt. At this point, people know what’s up. People know I’m smart.

**If you read a lot of the tabloid coverage, the implication is: Kim and her family are bringing you down. Jay Z and Beyonce didn’t show up at your wedding because of them. That kind of thing.**

All that, I wouldn’t even speak on. It doesn’t even matter to me whatsoever, who would show up. Because the most important person to show up there, to me, was Kim. And that’s all that matters to me. I had to fight for that for seven years. But the fact that these other people showed up that are from such different worlds but have done such dynamic things — they’re all, in a way, equal to what Kim has done in TV. It’s about the people, and the fact that they’re from different walks of life, and that they’re working together and not discriminating against each other. There was a class system, and now there’s a creative-class system, and I think that’s what you were talking about a bit — the class system of creativity.

**And my point was, they leave Kim out of it.**

And my point is, they were all at her wedding.

**A skeptic would say that’s because of you.**

But when an Instagram photo gets 2.3 million likes — 

**Your wedding photo, which is currently the most liked photo on Instagram ever.**

That’s because of who?

**I don’t know.**

Don’t say you don’t know! It’s because of Kim. Meaning there’s no photo that I would have put up by myself, or next to one of my smarty friends, that would have got that amount of likes. So now you take this photo that has that amount of likes, and it has a flower wall from the same guy who does the Lanvin shows, and it has a couture Givenchy dress and Givenchy tuxedo in it. That’s the point. Now the thing that is the most popular is also communicating the highest level of creativity. The concept of Kimye has more cultural significance than what Page Six could write.

Why’d you decide to get married?

Saying “Hey, I like Kim” isn’t as inspiring to people as us getting married. And anyone that’s in a relationship knows that in order to get to the point to get married and then to be married and to then carry on, it needs that work put into it. Right now, people look at it and it’s like, “Wow, that’s inspiring.” Meaning that love is infectious. You know, God is infectious — God flowing through us and us being little baby creators and shit. But His energy and His love and what He wants us to have as people and the way He wants us to love each other, that is infectious. Like they said in Step Brothers: Never lose your dinosaur. This is the ultimate example of a person never losing his dinosaur. Meaning that even as I grew in cultural awareness and respect and was put higher in the class system in some way for being this musician, I never lost my dinosaur.

Kim is this girl who fucking turns me on. I love her. This is who I want to be next to and be around. And then people would try to say, “Well, you know, if you’re a musician, you should be with a musician, and if you want to design, you need to be with a girl from the design world.” I don’t give a fuck about people’s opinions. Because when a kid falls in love with an airplane or a bike or a dinosaur — especially if you’re an only child and it’s not because of the book that the sibling was reading — it’s like, fuck, you mean to tell me that the dinosaurs walked the earth and stuff like that?! That’s amazing! You mean to tell me that these giant multi-ton crafts can fly that fast and that loud, and they can flip, and there’s danger, the possibility of them exploding? That’s fucking cool! You mean to tell me that this girl with this fucking body and this face is also into style, and she’s a nice person, and she has her own money and is family-oriented? That’s just as cool as a fucking fighter jet or dinosaur! And just as rarely seen.

**How do you feel about Yeezus now, a year later?**

I think Yeezus is the beginning of a completely new era of music. It was all new rules. It just broke every rule possible. None of the ideas were popular ideas. Even “Bound 2,” when the video came out, I think people’s apprehension — I mean, it’s the same as any other Kanye West video. You just have colorful bears running around. It was completely morphed and weird and psychedelic and really druggy. I would have just liked to have had more nudity in it. That’s the only thing. I just want to do crazy, colorful shit like that that has more nudity.

**Were you mad when Rick Rubin said that you did half the vocals on Yeezus in two hours before hopping on a plane?**

Yeah! Because yeah, I rapped them. But I worked on them for like eight months! And the thing is, I had to finish the verses in order for the album to come out, and it’s game time. I didn’t freestyle those verses. That shit was worked and processed and Disneyfied and everything. By the way, those lines are super scary and serious, and everything that I’m saying on Yeezus is super politically direct, so I think that it’s funny that you said that, because I think he needs to clarify that to people — that I didn’t make it up in that time. I just said them in that time.

**When you said what you said last year about the fashion industry and your frustration with it, did your phone ring after that?**

It did move the needle. Only positive came from it. Maybe I’m not as good friends as I could have been with the Saint Laurent designer. And now I don’t get the red-and-black versions of the white-and-black pants that are in stores, or whatever I would have got as a musician. But other than that, that communication was real. Alexander Wang made sure that I was able to go to a Balenciaga show, and I was never allowed to do that before because I was a celebrity. Listen to what I’m saying — me, as Kanye West: I guarantee you, I’m more than 50 percent responsible for every men’s shoe that they sell. Me, the singular person. More than 50 percent responsible for every Balenciaga shoe they sell. And they would say, “You can’t come to the show, because you are a celebrity.” But all honesty, no ego, I have a level of influence, and I have a level of respect for the designers. And we move product on that Barneys floor.

There’s an analogy to music, right? You provided the sales template there, too. You can’t listen to rap now without hearing music that sounds like your old music, right?

It sounds exactly like that.

What does that mean in terms of putting the new record together? Do you want the pendulum to swing back and do something more pop, like Twisted Fantasy or Graduation ?

I think just my usual pattern is like that. It’s like a pendulum. The pendulum gains momentum by swinging in the other direction. Even lyrically, I think about certain lines that I say on my new single, which is called “All Day,” that usually Jay would say, but Jay’s not on there. So I say, All day, nigga, it’s Ye, nigga. Shopping for the winter, it’s just May, nigga. Ball so hard, man, this shit cray, nigga. You ain’t getting money unless you got eight figures. Right? Jay would have said that. And then, eventually, I would have came in with, like, whatever I come in with. But the balance of a meal is that when people walk in, they want water first. People definitely weren’t getting water first on Yeezus. I do fight with myself to say, “Keep fighting.” But also, you know, you can’t win every single fight. It’s a long war, and if you’re out there trying to, like, blow up every single building, you won’t win the war.

**You’ve said that one of the reasons you did Watch the Throne was that you wanted to learn to communicate in the easy way that Jay Z communicated. Do you feel like that experience helped you at all?**

Yes! It’s picking up skill sets that give you longevity. That’s what I like about Jay. He has longevity. He’s still at the top of relevancy from the way he moves, the way he interacts with people, his ability to brush things off of his shoulder and just win at life. He’s the poster child of winning. And I think I was the poster child of, like, fighting and winning. But you always saw the fight. And with Jay, you always saw the win.

**Another gifted communicator in your life is Kim. Have you learned from her?**

That’s funny that you’re saying that. One of the reasons why I think that me and Kim are very powerful together isn’t just the concept of celebrity or this mega rap star and this mega-beautiful pop star. It’s something I explain to my girl: She is who she is. I am who I am. We have advisers and friends and everything, but those people are who they are and we are who we are. And what I had to learn from Kim is how to take more of her advice and less of other people’s advice. There’s a lot of Kim K skills that were added. In order to win at life, you need some Kim K skills, period.

**I feel like people have no idea if you’re ever actually happy, or what makes you happy.**

Well, when I work on an album, it’s fun at certain times. There’s some accomplishments and sometimes there’s a bit of frustration. And it’s usually like a nine-month process, right? This is a multi-lifetime process that we have now embarked on. Meaning starting now, you’re just starting to see a glimmer of what the idea of West will mean.

**But does happiness arrive at the end of that rainbow? I think people genuinely wonder that.**

Well, you build your happy wife, happy life, happy home, all this stuff, right? But what makes me happy is land, and we’re on a boat now. This is Christopher Columbus. This is uncharted waters we’re on. We’d be super happy to be on land, and also a little bit like, “Ah, the journey’s over!” But I feel like, we got the Vogue cover. Steve McQueen won the Oscar. We finally got married, you know? We have a child. We’re a family now. I am an arbiter of taste, and people think that I have the ability to make things cool — or if I’m doing it, it should be cool. And I feel that this stuff’s starting to be cool. And that feels good to me. Because I don’t like walking around with people thinking I’m doing uncool shit, because there’s nothing I’m doing that’s uncool. It’s all innovative. You just might not understand it yet. But it’s cool. Family is super cool. Going home to one girl every night is super cool. Just going home and getting on the floor and playing with your child is super cool. Not wearing a red leather jacket, and just looking like a dad and shit, is like super cool. Having someone that I can call Mom again. That shit is super cool.
