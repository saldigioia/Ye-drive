# Kanye West Dominates Source Nominations

Rapper-producer Kanye West received a leading seven Source Hip-Hop Music Awards nominations Thursday, while Ludacris got six.

West’s nominations included best album, video, lyricist and producer of the year.

Jay-Z, Ludacris, Lil Flip, Twista and Juvenile will battle for male artist of the year while Youngbloodz, Ying Yang Twins, 8Ball and MJG, Westside Connection and OutKast duke it for group of the year.

The Source Awards will be handed out Oct. 10 in Miami, as they have been since 2001.

David Mays, The Source magazine’s co-owner, also is planning a political rally during the Source Awards weekend which will go beyond just asking people to vote.

“The hip-hop community and media coverage has surrounded this simple concept of people voting,” Mays told The Associated Press. “That’s certainly a valuable thing, but this event is more about a very concrete agenda for the youth of America. I think it’s the thing that’s been missing in the hype. The needs of young people are not being addressed by politicians.”

Mays is inviting the Bush and Kerry daughters — who appeared at the recent MTV Video Music Awards — as well as a boatload of celebs and political types to debate the issues during the rally.

“If you want us to vote, you’ve got to address these issues,” Mays declared.

The Source Awards will air Nov. 30 on BET.
