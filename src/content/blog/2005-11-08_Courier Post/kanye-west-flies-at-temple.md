# Kanye West Flies at Temple

The Kanye West concert Sunday was hyped up with multitudes of fans coming to see the rapper perform with opening acts Keysha Cole and American Idol’s third season winner, Fantasia. Before the show, the fans were entertained by radio stations 96.5 WRDW-FM and 100.3 WPHI-FM giving out posters and other prizes. Even with hustling traffic, fans rushing as much as possible to get to the show on time, everything went smoothly. As the crowds of excited people started to fill in the seats you could feel the vibes eager for the concert to start.

Cole opened the show, lighting the crowd up with her new hit song “I Should Have Cheated” from her album The Way It Is. Then the stage sparked with Fantasia’s performance when she knocked off everyone’s socks off with her energetic singing as her amazing voice energetically echoed.

But the “Touch the Sky” theme and song which West performed was for a reason. It was like a flash back of Kanye West influences from people telling him he couldn’t make it or “Touch the Sky.” The fans were ready for the big moment. Kanye West entered the stage with his high energy and asked everyone to stand up and show love for his music. He put everyone’s feet up in motion with his “Diamonds” song from Sierra Leone.

But best of all West had a violinist team of girls to perform along with him in most of his songs, something about which he said, “No hip-hop artist has ever had on their mind to have violinists mix in their skills with mine.”

He performed the song “Drive Slow” demonstrating the dance move to the audience of his new video not yet released. West then twisted some emotional songs in the night, accompanied by Patti LaBelle messaging Hurricane Katrina victims and their families.

The audience was impacted emotionally by that moment, but were spiked back up with West’s “Gold Digger” song and accompanied by the audience who knew each word of the lyrics. The crowds cheered with high energy when the concert was coming to an end.
