# Kanye’s Year for Grammy ‘Graduation’

## Rapper’s Album Gets the Best Grades

Notorious for reacting angrily to award-show snubs, Kanye West likely will go from sore loser to sure winner in his third bid for the best-album Grammy.

Though the rapper lost 2004’s prize to Ray Charles and 2005’s to U2, prognosticators see him sailing to victory at Sunday’s Grammy Awards (CBS, 8 p.m. ET/PT) with Graduation.

“Kanye had the biggest opening week of any album last year, and he’s the only one of the five (nominees) to end up in the year’s top 10 best-selling CDs,” says veteran Grammy oracle Paul Grein, who writes Yahoo Music’s Chart Watch blog. “Plus, he’s awfully good. Stronger should have been up for record of the year.”

The death of his mother, Donda West, last fall from cosmetic surgery complications also might influence ballots.

“I hate to say it, but there’s a sympathy factor, though he’d have won without it,” Grein says.

He doubts rap resistance among older voters will prevent West’s triumph.

Outkast, the first rap act to clinch best album (2003), “won against an especially weak field,” Grein says. “This year’s nominees don’t strike me as weak. Kanye just towers above them. It’s a further sign that rap has infiltrated the mainstream and gathered the acceptance of Grammy voters.”

He’s up against Foo Fighters’ Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace, Vince Gill’s These Days, Herbie Hancock’s River: The Joni Letters and Amy Winehouse’s Back to Black.

Kanye wins on his merits and by elimination, says Tom O’Neil, columnist for awards insider TheEnvelope.com.

“Voters rarely reward country in the top race, and (Days) isn’t a career apogee, so Vince is a non-starter,” he says. “They love U2, but Foo isn’t iconic yet. And Amy? They don’t like troublemakers. Eminem got nominated twice and lost.

“With Kanye, it’s almost a Lord of the Rings sentiment. He’s here for the third time, so he’s earned it. But if I were him, I’d be a little worried about Herbie. The Grammys love veterans, and we’ve seen a trend in the album race of catching up with legends like Santana, Steely Dan and Ray Charles.”

Winehouse deserves to win, but her tabloid image probably hurt her chances, says Entertainment Weekly critic Chris Willman.

“It is so inevitable that Kanye West will finally get his moment in the Grammy sun, not least of all because he so obviously needs and wants for that to happen,” Willman says. “Voters may just get weary enough to think, ‘OK, let’s get it over with.’

“And, unlike Amy, there’s no doubt that Kanye will be holding his trophies, beaming and putting on a great show. That work ethic and obvious hunger for the prize has to count for something.”
