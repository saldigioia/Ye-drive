# Kanye West Proves He Can Produce on Stage

## Behind the Mike Instead of Behind the Scenes, He Delivers an Engaging, Guest-Packed Concert

Kanye West broke through in 2001 as a producer for Jay-Z and others and established himself this year as a double threat with “The College Dropout,” his superb debut album as a rapper. During his stellar 80-minute performance Sunday at the House of Blues, the Chicagoan showed he also knows how to deliver a thoroughly engaging concert.

Wearing a pink sport coat and Polo shirt, blue-green baseball cap and a designer backpack, West was an inviting presence as he took the stage, the instrumental to Jay-Z’s “Takeover,” which he produced, thumping from the speakers.

As a producer, West regularly samples from such R&B icons as Marvin Gaye and Luther Vandross, giving their songs a drum-heavy hip- hop makeover. On Sunday, West’s concert indeed seemed like a soul music revue. Violinist Miri Ben-Ari accented a number of West’s songs and offered her own mini-set, performing selections from Kurtis Blow and Michael Jackson, while fellow Chicago rapper Common also joined West for an extended time, and performed two of his own thrilling cuts.

Even when his friends were center stage, West stood by with a huge smile, seemingly basking in his ability to rock the crowd through his raps or his music.

Dilated Peoples, the L.A. rap trio whose third album arrives today, joined West after delivering a tight opening set.
