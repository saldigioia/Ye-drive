# West Marches On

Like last year's biggest hip hop star, 50 Cent, Chicago rapper and producer Kanye West has converted a near-death experience into a huge-selling album.

But whereas Fiddy saw being shot nine times by gangsters as a perverted badge of honor, West's tragedy is easier to relate to.

A car crash in October 2002 resulted in the three-time Mobo winner breaking his jaw in three places and rapping about it with his mouth wired almost closed on top 10 single Through the Wire.

Surprisingly sensibly for someone operating in a musical genre where glamorizing danger is almost obligatory, it includes the line: "Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt."

West contradicted more hip-hop conventions at his biggest UK show to date, first by appearing on time and performing for more than an hour. He also dressed against the grain, shunning the usual voluminous basketball shirt in favor of a pastel-blue Pringle jumper, white blazer, and cream slacks that made him look like he was on his way to a polo match. A hefty gold chain was his only concession to blingingness.

Despite being accompanied only by a fast-fingered DJ on a bare stage and a microphone that made him sound as though he was rapping from the bottom of a well, West's infectious energy and the strength of his songs made for a gripping evening.

He made his name producing tracks for stars including Jay-Z, Alicia Keys, and Common but kept many of his best tunes back for his debut solo album, The College Dropout, which has sold more than two million copies since its release in March.

Tracks such as Never Let Me Down and the loping School Spirit employed his trademark soul samples sung by chipmunks, while the marching beats of Jesus Walks provided a thunderous encore.

West proved himself to be a vital new talent who won't be retreating back to the other side of the studio glass any time soon.
