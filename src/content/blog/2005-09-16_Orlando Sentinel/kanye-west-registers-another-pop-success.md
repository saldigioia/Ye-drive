# Kanye West Registers Another Pop Success

As a hip-hop innovator, Kanye West stretches the genre in a different direction from underground progressives such as Atmosphere.

Late Registration, his highly anticipated follow-up to uber-hit The College Dropout, is a dazzling collection that makes hip-hop into pop, but not in a bad way.

The musical scope is positively grand, with Dropout’s beat- driven approach transformed into a lush of brass, strings and slick backing voices: Big ballads such as “Diamonds From Sierra Leone” and the 7-minute “We Major” are built on a wall of sound that would make Phil Spector jealous.

The album’s instrumental evolution comes courtesy of West’s co- producer Jon Brion, known for previous work with Fiona Apple and Aimee Mann. His influence on Late Registration won’t endear West to hardcore rap fans, but the beautiful arrangements are worth the sacrifice.

“Hey Mama,” West’s sentimental ode to his mother, proves that he doesn’t need to throw an orchestra at a song to make a point. Against the “la la las” of an earthy gospel chorus, the song’s message of gratitude and dedication (West promises to go back to school one day) is sweet and sincere. Eventually, the extra voices drop away to leave West alone with the keyboard and percolating bass line.

Along with all the instruments, Late Registration has a long list of guests that confirm West’s status as a pop-culture icon. Maroon 5’s Adam Levine’s high tenor is a nice counterpoint to the rapping and taut rhythm section on “Heard ‘Em Say.” Built on the melody of Natalie Cole’s “Someone That I Used to Love,” the song shows how West slips his message into a breezy backdrop:

“Before you ask me to go get a job today, can I at least get a raise in the minimum wage?”

Jamie Foxx returns to sing on “Gold Digger,” opening the song with his Ray Charles impression on “I Got a Woman” reconfigured with new lyrics.

Charles isn’t the only vintage musician to be sampled. A snippet of saxophone by jazz-funk hero Hank Crawford reflects the DNA of “Drive Slow,” West’s collaboration with rappers Paul Wall and GLC. Gil-Scott Heron’s “Home Is Where the Hatred Is” is showcased on West’s collaboration with Common on “My Way Home.”

Put it all together and Late Registration is more than rap, which also would describe the vision of the guy who made it.
