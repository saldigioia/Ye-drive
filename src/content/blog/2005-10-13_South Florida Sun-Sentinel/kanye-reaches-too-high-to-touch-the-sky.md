# Kanye Reaches Too High to `Touch the Sky'

To judge by opening night of his headlining U.S. tour, Kanye West doesn’t do “small.” The West-led bill that opened on Tuesday night at the University of Miami Convocation Center was all big, bold strokes very much in sync with the rapper’s iconic self-image. That he calls it the “Touch The Sky” tour shouldn’t surprise anyone.

West is making some concessions to scale: He smartly opened at a medium-sized venue instead of risking too many empty seats in a larger space. About 5,000 people, not quite enough to sell the place out, came out for Tuesday’s launch. What they got was a show that has stadium-sized grandeur, aims expressed in the production’s almost avant-garde staging, the use of a classical string section and, of course, West’s ambitious music.

The ambition sometimes got the better of this show, or at least it got the better of opening night. There were at some points so many things going on at one time, with the live band, the DJ, the strings, the strobe lights, the video and West’s syncopated rhymes, that the result was utter confusion. A few more nights on the road will tighten up some of the presentation. But a few segments, such as the set piece for Late, which West performed from a bed, may simply be overbuilt and in need of rethinking.

The concert’s best moments were the most direct and emphatic. The evening’s peak came with a rousing version of Jesus Walks, with its descending theme and West’s thunderous delivery. And don’t think West isn’t audacious enough to compare his struggles to those of Jesus. And when the audience took up the refrain of All Falls Down, in an exhilarating moment of bonding between performer and crowd, West suddenly had a few thousand disciples beckoning.

Even West’s quieter songs fairly screamed out their author’s desire to be definitive. In Hey Mama, West performed what he must think is the most compelling and authoritative ode ever from a son to a mother, and he rapped out the lyric convincingly, and with utter conviction of the song’s universality. Roses strove to be the most heartbreaking account of old age and poverty, and West performed it as if his heart were breaking.

West brought out rapper Common, a fellow Chicagoan, for a spirited duet on Go!, one of the West-produced songs on Common’s new album. Common was to have been one of “Touch The Sky’s” opening acts, but West said Common had a movie project that just came up and he could only drop in for an opening-night cameo. That may be the best alibi ever for skipping out on a tour.

There were two opening acts. Keyshia Cole sang underwhelming, standard-issue r&b pop over pre-recorded tracks. Fantasia Barrino, last year’s American Idol winner, brought a six-piece band and all of the peculiar, almost unhinged energy that made her one of Idol’s more daring picks. Her set included emotive, suitably high-strung versions of the r&b power ballad Ain’t Gonna Beg and the hit single Baby Mama as well as a surprisingly adventurous, re-arranged cover of Aerosmith’s classic-rock touchstone, Dream On.
