# Head of the Class

## Kanye West, June 2, 2004, Hard Rock Live, Orlando, Fla.

In an entertainment industry-savvy town like Orlando, even middle schoolers know not to look at the camera during a live taping. So you can be sure the crowd at the Kanye West show at Universal’s Hard Rock Live didn’t need anyone telling them what to do at this scheduled MTV shoot.

With all eyes on them, opening act Young Gunz generated some sparks early on with tunes like “Problemz,” but then slowed things down a bit for a worn-out Biggie/‘Pac call-and-response. They then fanned the flames again by calling Hova himself from the wings, hyping the crowd while a mikeless Jay soaked in the screams with near regal serenity. That was one of the few times the volume level taxed the Hard Rock sound system, which clearly operated in favor of someone like West, who gets by on more than just chanting and smash-your-head shock tactics. But after 45 minutes of arm waving and hand-signing the Roc symbol up in the air, it looked as if the headliner might have a hard time maintaining the crowd’s energy level.

Wrong! From the first line — “I’m trying to catch a beat”  — West took the baton and clobbered the audience with it. Even crunk territory had to give it up for the Windy City-bred backpack hero. Then again, this wasn’t exactly a crunk crowd; it was an often nattily collegiate Rainbow Coalition group — a medley of Real World types.

Rocking a magenta polo shirt, plaid shorts, and the requisite backpack, West worked the stage like a skilled boxer rather than a heavy-handed knockout artist — dropping a cool line here, kicking up the volume there. And while the crowd sang along with the live acoustic guitar-augmented “All Falls Down,” “Through the Wire,” and Luda’s “Stand Up” (which West produced), more often than not, crowd members were checking for subtle word- play in between the hooks, showing that this Mouse Town crowd didn’t need camera cues to show its appreciation.
