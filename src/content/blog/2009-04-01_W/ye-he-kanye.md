# Ye He Kanye

Since bursting onto the music scene in 2004, Kanye West has become quite a style aficionado. He drops names like Kate Moss and Louis Vuitton in his songs and is a front-row fixture at the runway shows in both New York and Europe. In January the singer and producer stepped even deeper into the fashion world, debuting a line of men’s sneakers for Louis Vuitton. West has a passion for kicks he owns about 400 pairs so he had some very specific design ideas. We started from the sole, he said. We made it lighter weight and flexible, so you can bend it. Louis Vuitton creative director Marc Jacobs was impressed with West’s work ethic. I think Kanye goes to the office more than I do, he said. He’s really, really into sneakers.
