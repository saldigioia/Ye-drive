# Kanye West Surprise Concerts at the Fondation Louis Vuitton

As exceptional as they were unexpected, Kanye West’s series of concerts at the Fondation Louis Vuitton hyped up Paris Fashion Week. All proceeds from the American artist’s performances will be donated to two nonprofit organizations.

Kanye West wowed the crowd with a four-night concert series from March 7-10 at the Fondation Louis Vuitton. The Frank Gehry designed Foundation – which has already welcomed over 400,000 fans of contemporary art, music and performance art – provided a stunning backdrop for Kanye West’s captivating live performances.

A keen fashion aficionado, the multi-talented hip-hop artist added his inimitable improvisational touch to the Paris Fashion Week calendar. The packed concerts were sold out on all four nights, raising funds for two nonprofit organizations. All proceeds are being donated to Donda’s House and the French association “Nos Quartiers ont des Talents” (Talent from the Neighborhood).

Donda’s House is a nonprofit founded in honor of Kanye West’s mother, Dr. Donda West, who was a noted professor and doctor of education. The organization provides access to premium arts instruction for youth to develop their creativity and well-being.

The nonprofit association “Nos Quartiers ont des Talents” helps find jobs for graduates from underserved neighborhoods and backgrounds in France. In 2014 a hundred LVMH managers mentored more than 100 young graduates. A total of 297 young people have found employment since 2007 after being coached by an LVMH employee. LVMH has been represented on the association’s board since 2011 and the Group is proud to support young talents from difficult neighborhoods to promote their inclusion.
