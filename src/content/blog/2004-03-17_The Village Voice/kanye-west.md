# Kanye West

What is the fuss about his contradictions? The main difference between him and most hip hop journalists is his money. They’d buy the Benz-so would I, Volvos don’t last as long-and probably the gold too. They’d say anything to get laid. They accept the economic rationale of dealing and dig music of dubious moral value. Yet at the same time they do their bit for racial righteousness and know full well how much they need the “single black female addicted to retail.” On Easter Sunday, some of them even believe in Jesus Christ. But none of them are as clever or as funny as Kanye West, and these days I’m not so sure about Eminem either. West came up as a beatmaster, but his Alicia Keys and Talib Kweli hits are pretty bland, and neither his voice nor his flow could lead anyone into sin. So he’d better conceptualize, and he does. Not only does he create a unique role model, that role model is dangerous-his arguments against education are as market-targeted as other rappers’ arguments for thug life. Don’t do what he says, kids, and don’t do what he does, because you can’t. Just stay in school. Really. I mean it.
