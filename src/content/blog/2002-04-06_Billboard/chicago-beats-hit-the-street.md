# Chicago Beats Hit the Street

## Hip-Hop Producers From the Windy City Are Making Names for Themselves and Turning Out Some New Talent.

Chicagoans have long been known for getting the job done, whatever that job might be, with a minimum of fanfare and fuss. That’s certainly the case with the city’s hip-hop-production community. Chicago-based producers (some of whom are also artists themselves) supply beats for some of the biggest names in the rap world, while at the same time working to bring gifted local-artist proteges into the national spotlight. It’s hard to get around the fact that Chicago’s accomplishments are minimally recognized—for now—but many believe that situation is changing, and they are striving to effect that change more quickly.

“Chicago has a ‘hustle’ mentality,” says David Leonard, national director of rhythm/crossover mix-show promotion for leading independent radio-marketing and promotion firm Jeff McClusky & Associates, based in Chicago. He’s referring to the tireless work ethic embodied by so many local industry figures. “They’re not caught up in hype. They study and perfect their craft and pursue relationships to get to the next level. They’re not interested in just cranking out ‘hits.’ There are so many producers and artists here with talent and potential that have gone unnoticed, but it won’t stay that way for long,” he says.

Leonard notes that a recent addition to Chicago’s urban-radio lineup on Power 92 (WPWX) has been devoting an hour every week to homegrown talent.

Chicago’s leading lights in hip-hop production include Xtreme (Jay-Z, Dr. Dre, DMX, Ed O.G.), who has formed a partnership called The Foundation with No I.D., the Chicago producer who brought groundbreaking rapper Common to the world’s attention and has since worked with Beanie Sigel, Memphis Bleek, Montell Jordan and Dead Prez; Kanye West (Beanie Sigel, Jay-Z, Lil’ Kim, Jermaine Dupri, Da Brat, Jagged Edge, Talib Kweli, Puff Daddy, Foxy Brown, Nas), who is no longer physically based in the city but who continues to shepherd Chicago talent into the limelight; and The Legendary Traxster (Twista, Mic Geronimo, Mystikal).

In the city’s fertile underground scene, producer Panik (of rap crew Molemen) is developing an ever-strengthening rep—one client, Planet Asia, went on to sign with Interscope. Local rapper S.P.O., formerly a member of renowned hip-hop collective Rubberoom, records for, as well as oversees a stable of artists on, his own indie label, Windy Whooosh Wreckordz. Another nascent entrepreneur, Darrell Young, came to Chicago from the South, because he saw the Windy City as the logical place from which to launch his label, Don-Dada Records.

### Business With Jay-Z

Xtreme’s major break reads like something out of movie lore—the one having to do with Schwab’s Drugstore. Two years ago, when Jay-Z’s Hard Knock Life Tour came through Chicago, Xtreme was in the studio producing Chicago group Skunk Militia. He says he was driving through the city’s West Side one day, “playing some beats I’d just put together,” when a car pulled up next to him at a stoplight. The driver asked Xtreme what he was listening to, and when the producer replied, “Something I did,” a head popped out that Xtreme recognized quite well—it was Jay-Z. The rap superstar told Xtreme, “Pull over. I want that beat!”

“He said he’d call me the next Friday, but I didn’t think he actually would,” says Xtreme. “But I did get a call from Roc-A-Fella Records asking, ‘Can we do business?’ I sold my first beat to Jay-Z, and it opened the door for me.”

Xtreme, who was named Producer of the Year at 2001’s Chicago Music Awards, has since worked with Musiq Soulchild and DJ Clue (DefJam), among others. With No I.D., Xtreme is producing Dr. Dre protege Shaunta (Aftermath/Interscope), and the duo is currently submitting beats for Dre’s new Chronic album. Plus, he’s overseeing two fledgling artists, Jameisha Trice and Ras Rock, via his own production company, Burnin’ Hot Entertainment.

Xtreme notes that their partnership is unusual for Chicago, as the dearth of industry attention (and its attendant funding) in the city has resulted in more of an everyone-for-himself atmosphere, than one of cooperation and sharing. It’s difficult even for him, he says, to make a comfortable living simply producing local artists. A beat that would fetch $12,000 on either coast goes for $5,000 in the Windy City, and local artists generally can’t pony up even that much. “So, you have to sell beats for $500 to $1,000,” he says. “You either have to do a lot of independent work or be able to fly out to New York or L.A. [on a regular basis, to work with the big names].”

### Xtreme Team

Xtreme, No I.D. and others are endeavoring to raise Chicago’s profile, so that the genre’s stars will come here to work. “We want to show everybody that [collaborating] is the way to do it,” says Xtreme, who claims there is an identifiable Chicago sound on current hip-hop records, one that draws on the city’s venerable soul tradition. “The East Coast sound has more of a reggae influence, since they’re close to the Caribbean, while Chicago draws from the deep soul, gospel and blues of the South. Our biggest influences include the Chi-Lites and Quincy Jones—the sounds we grew up with, we’re remanifesting as adults.”

“The trend [in rap and hip-hop] now is neo-soul,” observes No I.D., “but what we’re doing now [with new protege K. Fox] is even more soulful. It’s a mixture of [current] R&B and old R&B, but it feels like [new-millennium] hip-hop.”

The producer says he stopped working with Common when the rapper, with whom he’d collaborated since 1992, signed with MCA in 1998 and, according to No I.D., headed in a neo-soul direction himself. No I.D. was less than enamored with the trend-hopping direction rap was then taking, he says, and opted for producing straight R&B.

It was Xtreme who, upon hearing his future partner’s R&B work, gave his honest assessment. “It’s good, but it’s not No I.D. Bring No I.D. to R&B,” he said. Eventually, No I.D. came back to hip-hop. “I’d been a house DJ, so I brought a more musical element to it, as opposed to [one that was] just rhythm-based,” No I.D. says.

At press time, No I.D. was in Atlanta, along with Xtreme, finishing an album project at 302 Studios with K. Fox, whom MCA-distributed Magic Johnson Records has just signed. “We’re shooting for cameos on the album by artists like Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight and Frankie Beverly and Maize,” he says, noting that Chicago DJ Teefa, whose album No I.D. is producing, cameos on the K. Fox project.

“There’s so much talent in Chicago, but no one wants to sacrifice glamour and glitz to work on it,” says No I.D. “People have gotten too sidetracked by what they see in music videos. Working with Common, we got to a point where the only thing we could do was make more money—there was nothing to accomplish besides financial gain. I didn’t want to change my style for the chance of even bigger success.”

Striving to get Chicago artists off the ground and raise the profile of the city is “a long, hard road,” he acknowledges, but he believes it’s one that offers the most artistic rewards.

“Struggling artists can only benefit from collaboration and openness,” says underground producer Panik, who networks tirelessly and carries a beats sampler everywhere he goes, since you never know who you’ll run into. “I never feel threatened; I feel all of us should be open, since the only person who can take from you is yourself.”

### Chicago Pride

Of course, there are those producers who, having reached a certain level, want more than the city has to offer. When Kanye West moved to the East Coast a year ago, he expanded his already-impressive resume exponentially, collaborating with the likes of Ludacris, Mos Def, Freeway, Scar-face and Alicia Keys. He received his first platinum album for his work on Jermaine Dupri’s 1998 release Life in 1472 and now boasts more than a dozen platinum and gold plaques. “I was tired of the indie route,” he says. “This time last year, I was selling beats for $500 out of my crib. Now, I can get label heads on the phone; I can get deals for my groups.

Still, West is shopping two Chicago acts, an MC named Rhymefest and a duo called the Go-getters, via his boutique production company Kon Man Entertainment; he also represents Chicago producer Brian Allday Miller, who’s creating some beats for West’s upcoming solo album. “I love Chicago,” says West, “and I love to give back to the city.”

S.P.O. and his Windy Whooosh Wreckordz stable—P’casso, Sudan and Lone Assasin—are giving back by staying put. “We’re trying to bring it right here,” says S.P.O., a Texas native who started MCing in Chicago in 1990, joining Rubberoom two years later. Going solo again, he began scouting clubs for talent, which is where he found Windy Whooosh’s roster. Now, in between performing at Windy Whooosh showcase nights, S.P.O. gets promos (including singles from the label’s new 13-song compilation, Windy Whooosh Wreck!) to club DJs, distributes flyers, shops for distribution deals and networks constantly. “Everybody in my camp is so different,” says S.P.O., “but we’ve all got Chicago pride.”

So does Chicago-born Darrell Young, who launched his Don-Dada Records here after relocating from Mississippi. He mines the heretofore obscure suburb of North Chicago, which he describes as an untapped hotbed, for his talent roster, which currently includes brother/sister act Reflux, rap crew Black Assassins, rapper Quarter-Key and R&B singer Janielle. Young has joined forces with local marketing company JW Promotions, headed by former Virgin Records executive Jeanne Warsaw, and records his acts at the high-profile studio Chicago Trax, owned by R&B superstar R. Kelly. Says Young, “We’re working on putting Chicago on the map.”
