# West Makes Waves

Controversy fits Kanye West like those crew-neck sweaters he sometimes wears.

It’s been less than two years since he burst onto the music scene with his debut album “The College Dropout,” after making a name for himself producing artists like Jay-Z and Alicia Keys.

The disc garnered critical acclaim and a batch of Grammy and American Music Awards nominations. But West, the son of a university professor and a Black-Panther-turned-Christian-counselor, isn’t content to rest on gold records or good reviews.

After losing out at the American Music Awards last year, West claimed he was “robbed.” At the Grammys, where he won three trophies out of 10 nominations, West complained that he should have received even more nominations.

In the way of so many musicians before him, from Bob Dylan to Public Enemy, West has used the platform of his music to rock the boat a bit, to generate musical waves whose impact seeps into the wider realm of society. On a recent MTV special, West offered an unusual plea, asking rappers to stop gay-bashing.

Most recently, he fired up political pundits and bloggers with an un- scripted moment at a Hurricane Katrina relief telethon last month, when he deviated from the script to talk about media coverage of the hurricane.

The media, West said, put a negative spin on African Americans affected by the storm. West also said, “George Bush doesn’t care about black people,” which was deleted from later broadcasts of the telethon.

Rap has long been fertile ground for political and social commentary; Public Enemy’s Chuck D once described it as the African-American version of CNN. But in recent years, much of the focus has shifted to the blinging-and-banging gangsta lifestyle of guns and luxury goods.

But West has given hip-hop a different look and sound. He has spoken out about the brutal African diamond trade in “Diamonds From Sierra Leone,” and the American health-care system in “Roses.”

His song “Jesus Walks” offers a rare-for-secular-rap mention of God and proclaims that “hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers” need to look at their spiritual side. “The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that’s the way y’all need Jesus,” the song says.

West’s style mirrors the diversity of hip-hop’s listeners, said K.J. Bland, interim program director for Greenville’s WJMZ-FM.

“He reflects the genre of people and listeners who are striving for more education and information, versus totally relying on gangsta rap,” Bland said. “He is showing a different angle, if you will, of society, where people don’t necessarily always have to come from the projects or always have to live that gangsta lifestyle to speak about it in their raps. His spectrum is so broad that he can speak about just about anything.”

All of West’s straight talk hasn’t appeared to hurt his career; “The College Dropout” went double platinum, as has his new album, “Late Registration.”

West has said he hopes to do more with his music than make the ears happy for a few minutes.

“I want to give people something that will stick with them the rest of their lives, something that will help them,” West told the San Diego Union-Tribune earlier this year. “It’s like gospel music with cursing. Actually, I wouldn’t even say with curse words. I’d say with profanity, because curse words bring you down and everything on my album brings you up. ... That’s what I do, I entertain and enlighten at the same time. I talk about very serious issues, and hide them behind similes and metaphors.”
