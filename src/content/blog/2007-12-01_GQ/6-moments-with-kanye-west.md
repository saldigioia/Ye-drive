# 6 Moments With Kanye West

## He Sold Half a Million Copies of His Latest Album, ‘Graduation,’ in a Day (Leaving 50 Cent in the Dust), Has Been Showered With Critical Accolades, and Has Cemented His Status as a Musical Icon. But Kanye West Still Doesn’t a Musical but Kanye West Think He’s Getting His Due. He’s Right.

Talking into a camera as he left the Wendy Williams radio show this September, fired up by a little champagne and the success of his new album, Kanye West offered an update on how 2007 was going for him. “I’m the number one artist in the world right now,” he declared, pushing his face toward the lens. “I want you to *document* this right here, what I’m saying right now. I am the number one human being in music. That means any person that’s living or *breathing* is number two. Because I’m number one now…. You are in the presence of the champion. Bow in the presence of greatness….”

On a more sober and reflective afternoon a few days later, sitting in his sparse, modernist New York apartment, West sees little reason to soften or withdraw this claim. That’s the thing about being drunk, he says. You say what you really believe to be true. “People got to look at the concerts, look at the sales, look at the impact, look at the songs, look at the connection with pop culture,” he continues. “I mean…it’s *obvious*. It’s almost I don’t even need to state it. It’s so true it’s obvious. It’s not even arguable.”

It is partly West’s readiness to proclaim what he sees as such obviousnesses that, in a world where such thoughts are generally expected to be disguised behind the politeness or hypocrisy of insincere humility, has contributed to his reputation for arrogance. He knows this: “This stuff I am saying is so politically incorrect it is so not what an artist should say and so not humble and stuff like that, but the only problem with all that it’s so not is: it’s so true.” To him, this passionate plain-speaking is not arrogance, and the accusation is one that clearly frustrates him — he points out how overcareful he is, in the flesh, to treat people considerately, because he’s so worried that they’ll think he’s like people say he is. Likewise, he’s emphatic that this competitiveness with his peers comes from a position of respect, hyper-competitive as he may be: “All I did was talk about how I looked up to Justin or to Beyoncé, looking at what they did. But I’m looking at everything everybody does. I’m looking at everything T.I. does, I’m looking at everything Lil Wayne does, I’m looking at everything Jeezy does, I’m looking at everything Jay-Z does, I’m looking at everything the Killers do, I’m looking at everything Red Hot Chili Peppers does, I’m looking at everything U2 does, I’m looking at everything Rolling Stones does, I’m looking at stuff that Justice does, I’m looking at stuff the Arctic Monkeys do, I’m looking at stuff that TV On The Radio does, I’m looking at Dr. Dre, I’m looking at Timbaland, I’m looking at the Pussycat Dolls. So I’m looking at all these different things, and my goal is to take out everybody. My goal is to completely dominate.”

*And how is that going?*

“It *went*. You know what, I can’t say that as a fact but I feel like that — that I am the number one human being in music — and if I go into the studio I feel I’m going to make the most amazing song that you’ve ever heard. I feel like Graduation is nowhere near as good as I can do, but it is the best thing this year in music.” Sometime over the next few weeks, Kanye West is planning to get a new tattoo. He knows what it will say — he just needs to decide where to put it and what font to use. (How very marvelously Kanye West this seems: a desire to permanently mark his body with a slogan of defiance twinned with concern over a *font*.) The tattoo itself will deliver a message from West to the world:

> I’D RATHER BE HATED FOR WHO I AM THAN LOVED FOR WHO I’M NOT.

Though Graduation has been widely and accurately hailed as a grand triumph, Kanye West has been annoyed by many things that have been printed about him this year. One of those that stung the most was in a *Harper’s Bazaar* interiors feature documenting the lavish Los Angeles home he shares with his fiancée, clothing designer Alexis Phifer. There is a large mural on one of his ceilings, and the magazine reported that the mural’s central figure — a large black angel rising up out of the picture, and hence down into West’s house — was of West himself. It wasn’t.

“That pissed me off so bad,” he says. “That made me so mad. Because who wants to hang out with a guy with an eight-foot picture of an angel of himself?”

The painting, by the artist Ernie Barnes, relates to the car accident Kanye had in October 2002. Driving from the recording studio at four in the morning, Kanye fell asleep at the wheel and had to be cut out of the car — an experience he described in his first hit single, “Through the Wire,” his rap supposedly recorded while his mouth was still wired shut. This story, told over and over, became a central part of the Kanye West mythology as his first album, *The College Dropout*, took off, and Kanye was quite open about the fact that it added a little rapper toughness to his allure — something somewhat lacking in a middle-class Chicago boy who had met some resistance making the leap from rap producer (most memorably on Jay-Z’s *The Blueprint*) to artist. What was rarely mentioned, until detailed this year in Raising Kanye, a book by his mother, Donda, was that West was not the only person injured that night — that, as he lost control, his Lexus swerved across the road into an oncoming vehicle. The other driver broke both legs. (Kanye points out that he did acknowledge that someone else was involved within the song itself — *I swear to God driver two wanna sue / I got lawyer for the case to keep what’s in my safe safe* — though he now concedes “the line was kind of bogus.”)

“I’m blessed I didn’t kill him,” he says today. When I ask him, just confirming, whether it was his fault, he says, “Yeah.” He tells me that at the time he was counseled to lie about it: “It was really my fiancée that influenced me not to do that, to be honest about it. She’s the one who told me you shouldn’t do that..” And with that, he abruptly changes flow, mid-subject, to admire the way the late-afternoon Lower Manhattan light, as seen through his gauzelike blinds, plays on the nearby buildings. “Wow, man, this really looks pretty through this,” he says. “I never really noticed this. It turns into a painting.”

One thing for which Kanye West has perhaps become too famous is his behavior at, and around, awards shows. The most recent example came at this year’s MTV awards — an extraordinary film clip circulated afterward of West ranting furiously backstage. West wishes people would realize that he was less annoyed at failing to win any of the five awards for which he was nominated than by the fact that he wasn’t allowed to perform his single “Stronger” in the main auditorium. Instead, an excerpt of a filmed performance in a Vegas “suite” was shown. “It’s really a thing about wanting to perform and having the opportunity to make history,” he argues. “That’s what I was mad about.” (Isn’t that exactly the kind of artist the struggling old-school record industry most needs right now: one who still sees an awards show as a chance not just to perform his new single but to make history?)

West’s most famous awards meltdown occurred last year at the European MTV awards. West says that he had been told beforehand that he was to win the best video award for his Evel Knievel-parodying, Pamela Anderson-starring video for “Touch the Sky.” When a video he had never seen for Justice vs. Simian’s “We Are Your Friends” won instead, he joined the winners on the stage and denounced the result as a travesty. The media weren’t kind: “They made it seem like I’d killed somebody.” West considers that the backlash that followed was further fueled when he made “this comment about how me and my friends like mutts. On black radio, they took a real offense at that.” This year, he says, has been his comeback.

West is in New York right now to appear on *Saturday Night Live*, where he will perform but also appear in a skit based on an idea he had ages ago, in which he would be at an awards ceremony and try to claim every award going — Best Female Singer, Best Country Album — even when absurdly inappropriate. “They improved on it,” he says.

As West prepares in his dressing room, Lorne Michaels pops in to say hello.

“So you know,” West tells him, “I’m not mad at all that I’m not hosting, in case you thought I was.” (He is reacting to the fact that there are some jokes written into the awards skit that imply this to be West’s attitude.) “And it seems like something I would be, and would have a right to be,” West says, “but I’m telling you I’m not.” Michaels tells him they’re building toward the time when he can host. West suggests that this will be a good thing and that when he does so it will be “retarded.” Michaels nods. “That’s retarded, like, in a good way,” West clarifies.

They chat on, about Andy Kaufman and about West’s frustrations at those MTV awards. “I think in music right now, all you have is me, Justin, and Beyonce,” West says. “Everybody else is another thing. Me, Justin, and Beyoncé are across-the-board-ers. Like, black people don’t super love Amy Winehouse like that — not yet. Not that they couldn’t. Me, Justin, and Beyoncé are the only… Britney at one time — not anymore. Eminem at one time. And I just think TV should reward the few people in music that are, like, that important.”

“The thing is,” Michaels assures him, “you’ve already won.”

“No, I haven’t,” says West, firmly. “I didn’t win that award.”

“The awards, I tell you,” says Michaels, “that’s *icing*.”

“It is,” West concedes. “But I *like* icing.”

Kanye West’s years in pop music have also been marked by an evolution in his thinking. Most famously, in a 2005 MTV interview he denounced homophobia in the rap world, describing how his own homophobia had developed partly in response to being called a mama’s boy and mentioning his discovery that one of his cousins was gay. There have been other changes. To me, he explains how, in the lyrics to his glorious summer hit “Can’t Tell Me Nothing” (“my first official hood classic,” he proudly notes), he consciously used the word homey each time where the word nigga would have come more naturally. I’m prompted to mention an early, less enlightened lyric I had stumbled across on YouTube:

*Because when you started out, you’d say things like “Kanye the best-dressed nigga next to fags.”*

“Oh, man.”

*Do you remember saying that?*

“Yeah. I always wanted that rap to come back out again like that. You don’t think that’s a really good line?”

*Well, apart from being unbelievably offensive, I can see why it appeals to you. But it is really offensive.*

“I feel like I’m getting to the point when I’m, like, so cool with gay people that they might give me a pass to say the word fag.”

*I’m not sure that pass exists.*

“Well, maybe not. I guess there are no white people who are really allowed to say nigga, so I guess there shouldn’t be any straight guys who are allowed to say fag.”

*I think that’s probably a good rule of thumb. You probably don’t think much of white guys who think they’re exempt from those rules.*

“Yeah. But for me, it’s a new discovery, because I feel accomplished that as a black male and as a rapper that I can actually… I’m to the point where I’ve let down so many of my prejudices, so I feel like I can have full conversations with gay people. There was a point where I felt like I wouldn’t want to ride in a car with a gay guy.”

*Really?*

“That’s any black guy. You don’t know that about us? Were crazy homophobic. Black men, especially if you’re a rapper or athlete.”

*Since you spoke out against homophobia in rap, you’ve faced plenty of insults.*

“Yeah, it’s ‘You must be gay, then. That shows you how our mentality is — that’s how much straight black males are homophobic and hate gay people, that if a straight black guy says, ‘Hey, don’t dis gay people, they say, Fuck, you must be gay? If I was gay, I would tell you. I don’t have a problem with gay, but I’m not gay, so don’t say that about me, because I’ve got to take enough shit for everything that is true about me.”

*Your Wikipedia page got changed the other day so that you were described in it as “an American faggot.”*

“Word?”

*Your fans quickly changed it back.*

“If I dress a certain way, or meet a designer I look up to, or someone in my family, or talk to a guy on the street who might be  gay, people are going to say I’m gay. Look at the mentality of black America today. That’s why the thing I most wish I could change about myself sometimes is to be more masculine. But in fact my response is to say fuck you, and that is another level of confidence.”

*If you worked on the mutt thing, you’d be fairly politically correct.*

“Yeah. And not use the word fag.”

*That too.*

“Yeah. But if I’m just around my friends, we’ll talk shit about everybody — everybody who I can’t name because I don’t want to fuck up every possible sponsorship that I can get in the future. But that’s what real people do. Real white dudes in the privacy of other white dudes use the word nigger, tell racist black jokes. It is what it is. America, wake up. Racism is here. As long as there is races there will be racism; as long as there is people with different religions there will be prejudice; as long as there are people with different sexual orientation there will be prejudice. I think one of the features of being masculine is being closed-minded. Being Christian, too.”

*But isn’t that closed-mindedness something to spend our lives fighting against?*

“Well, yeah-it’s what I’m always trying to do. I’m always trying to fuck with people’s perceptions and say, ‘Yo, that’s stupid…this is not right? I’m always trying to expose the truth.”

Kanye West’s fascination with porn was sparked when he came across one of his father’s magazines at a very young age. “It just excited me,” he says. ”I just liked it. I liked it a lot.” Later he was caught at school with a magazine, and in an attempt to enlighten him his mother made him write an essay titled “The Impact of Watching X-Rated Movies on a Teenage Boy.” If it was intended to deter him, it failed. “I started giving examples of people I knew who saw them from when they were young — ‘But this guy turned out pretty good’ — so I was giving rebuttals. I have friends who say successful men have high sex drives. Have you ever heard that before?”

*I guess, but I think I’ve heard the opposite theory, too — that people who don’t have high sex drives need somewhere to put all that energy and creativity.*

“Oh, okay.”

*Do you have very particular taste in it?*

“I like mutts. [Laughs] Put in there that I just said that just to joke off the fact that that word was so controversial. I’m sorry. But, of course, who doesn’t think that the Brazilian joints are the best?”

*Do you watch new stuff all the time, or do you have old favorites?*

“Both. The same thing with clothing, with anything: look, listen, learn, consume. Look, listen, learn, consume, create, which I haven’t applied to that field because I think it would have some hindrance to some of the other stuff I’m doing. That career choice popped in my head once or twice.”

*To be a male porn star?*

“Yeah. But what guy doesn’t want to be that? Just sometimes in their life. Just riding around: Yo, where’s all the fucking porn stars? This is my mentality before I was, like, engaged. Let me put that in there, because I don’t want this article to come out and make my fiancée feel like a piece of shit. You didn’t ask me this question, but when I say ‘How you stay faithful in a room full of hoes?’ I was just explaining today, it’s like when you first get money, you’re going to go to the Gucci store, you go to the Louis store, you buy two of this, three of that. And now I’ve finally matured, and I’m in a place where I can actually be faithful. I’ll see a super-attractive girl and look and say ‘Wow, she looks nice, and just let it be that. It’s not always that predator I-have-to-have-everything mentality that you can have in a sneaker store or in the music store. I used to be ‘I have to have that, I have to have that, I have to have that’-I think that could be the influence of watching pornography. You see a girl walk, and you instantly do the Howard Stern and undress her and shit with your eyes — I know a shitload about women’s anatomy. It puts you in a wolf mentality. The whole goal is find girl, get laid. I think the Devil basically put a crack in the structure-God made us find girl, get laid, have family, but the crack in the structure is find girl, get laid… and before I have a family there’s another girl right here.”

*So how are you going to deal with that crack in the structure?*

“Just maturing and being able to fight temptation. It’s a similar type of impulse as over-shopping. Being a shopaholic. Or, when you’re a little kid, you try and get as many phone numbers in the mall as you could. Grown guys are big kids.”

*Do you think you’ll be married by the time this article comes out?*

“Yeah, I think so. I’m just going to go and get married-Im not going to make a big deal out of it. It’s not to prove anything to anyone-it’s for me, for stability in my life, and I’m so happy that I found someone that I really love, that challenges me, that keeps my life interesting, that’s just as crazy as I am. Even though she would act like she wasn’t. I think that both of us, we’re really special, and when you see those things combine it’s something even greater. It’s like when me and 50 came together to drop the album, we sold so much more — me and my girl come together it’s so much more we can do as a team.”

*I hope you don’t get on with her like you get on with 50 Cent.*

“Oh, the 50 Cent thing is way more intimate.” [laughs]

*Whose idea was that war with 50 Cent?*

“Oh, that was my idea. I knew it was going to take off as soon as we were going to come out on the same date. Think about it — you got the two biggest shit-talkers in rap history. There’s no one known in rap history for talking more shit than me and 50. That’s something I will stand on.”

*Did you just think of it as a publicity stunt or as a serous competition?*

“Both. It was a complete publicity stunt.”

*What really made it catch people’s imagination was him saying he’d retire if he lost.*

“Oh, man, he sold me so many records by saying that. Man, 50 Cent is really one of my favorite rappers, too. I almost feel bad.”

*Were you secretly pretty confident you’d win?*

“Yeah. I have my finger on the pulse of pop culture…and ‘Stronger, I knew it was going to pierce American pop culture. And after doing stadiums and stuff with Bono, I understood a little bit more about making songs that would connect on that stadium level.”

*That’s your ambition, right? To be the first rap artist who can do that on a stadium level?*

“Mmm-hmmm.”

*Have you worked out how to do it?*

“By delivering super good songs that connect with every type of person across the world. I try to make an album where every song is everything.”

*Why has no rapper been able to do it on that scale yet? Is it a problem with rap or is it a problem with the rappers so far?*

“It’s rap. Rap is a glass ceiling. It’s like if Shakira tried to take over America with a Spanish album. People don’t understand rap in certain countries. There are people who don’t like rap. I’m up against a lot of things: I’m fighting because I’m black, I’m fighting because I rap and people don’t like rap, and I’m fighting because some people just frankly don’t like me. ‘Stronger’ is a full-on rock song. The whole album is full-on stadium rock songs hidden behind black drums.”

*So many of your influences now seem to be white pop, rock, and indie music.*

“Mmm-hmm. But I don’t think you hear that in my music. I don’t think you hear Feist in my music. I don’t think you hear Red Hot Chili Peppers to that extreme. It still completely sounds like it’s rap, but it uses every principle of rock songs, it uses every principle of stadium songs. ‘I Wonder’ is my take on U2’s ‘City of Blinding Lights’-they used to open the shows with that, and I saw the way it impacted. I said, ‘I want one of those songs right there.’”

Blender *magazine, weighing up your current musical influences and interests, recently concluded, “Maybe it’s Kanye West who doesn’t care about black people.” What did you make of that?*

“I love black people. I still make black music. I’m a black person. I just listen to other types of music to get influences. I just don’t listen to rap. I don’t need to. I do it too good. Why not study shit you don’t do good?”

When i first stepped into the NBC lobby with West, on the way to the Saturday Night Live rehearsals, he turned to me and said, “I know what you’re going to ask me about.” I had no idea what he meant, but that was only because I had forgotten that the post-Katrina telethon was filmed here — the telethon in which an emotional, stuttering West, standing alongside Mike Myers, veered way off teleprompter and improvised his way to the most memorable seven words he had ever said: “George Bush doesn’t care about black people.”

We don’t discuss this until the following week, when West is in another lobby, this time of a smart Parisian hotel, where I have interrupted a holiday with his fiancée. “With that Bush comment, what’s the end result of that?” he wonders. “It’s like ‘national hero, or is it like — and I won’t even will negativity into fruition, but it’s a scary thing. There’s been black celebrities in the past that were as hot as me, if not hotter, that chose to speak how they really felt about certain situations, and they’re not hot like that anymore.”

*Do you really have some genuine fear that something could have happened after you said what you said?*

“I believe that there were definitely some doors shut because of it.”

*But surely some doors opened, too, because of it?*

“Yeah. But the thing I want to stress is I’m not into politics.”

*Someday, whether it’s soon or far away, I imagine you’ll be in the same room as George Bush…*

“You can’t say that for sure.”

*When you look into each other’s eyes, what are you going to be thinking?*

“Well, I don’t know that much about Bush. I don’t know that much about politics.”

*While I don’t feel very sympathetic toward him, I figure you probably really hurt him.*

“So you think he’s going to come up to me and say, ‘Kanye, that really hurt me’?”

*I don’t know, but my hunch is that he doesn’t himself for a moment believe what you said to be true, and to a guy who doesn’t believe that to be true, that’s a heartbreaking thing to have someone say.*

“And to have it echo. Because look at how frustrated I am when people say things that I don’t agree with about me and people believe it. [pause] It doesn’t seem like a wise conversation for me to have — to even look at Bush like a human being. You know what I’m saying? As a real person who actually had to deal with that. The one thing I do know about Bush that I do respect about him is the fact that he can really deal with being the bad guy. Because he’s one of a lot of bad guys, and when all of them go to the country club, he’s the one who has to deal with it. Somebody had to be the face of all the shit, and the one thing I respect is the fact that he can deal with being the bad guy. A real-life supervillain.”

*So you’ve got a kind of weird, twisted respect for him, but no sympathy?*

“I’m sympathetic for anybody that has to deal with any type of hardship or pain. I’m not trying to do any cleanup or anything like that — I stand behind my statement 100 percent — I just think, wow, it takes a different kind of person to be that guy.”
