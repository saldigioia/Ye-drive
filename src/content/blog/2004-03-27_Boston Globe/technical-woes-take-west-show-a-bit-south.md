# Technical Woes Take West Show a Bit South

WORCESTER — Even if you haven’t heard Kanye West’s album, “The College Dropout,” you’ve probably heard his music. He has compiled a resume of work behind the scenes (with Jay-Z, Ludacris, Alicia Keys, Britney Spears) that has made him one of the most sought-after producers in the business.

With the CD, one of the best debut efforts in recent hip-hop history, he may just prove to be a star on the stage as well as in the studio.

But his show Tuesday night at the Worcester Palladium was not indicative of his immense talent - largely because of technical difficulties.

Longtime fans know that hip-hop performances have a history of sound problems. But at the Palladium they reached a new low: It seemed as if there had been no sound check at all.

After an hour-and-10-minute wait, West, with his colorful Polo shirt collar popped up, took the stage to the sounds of his love song to Chicago, “Home,” and all seemed forgiven. The hands in the air formed the diamond sign that is synonymous with Rocafella Records (West’s label), and the crowd rapped along to every word on album cuts like “We Don’t Care.”

But John Legend’s keyboard was distractingly loud, while his mike was at a whisper. West’s mike, often hampered by feedback, went out at several points and sank to an inexcusable level when he was forced to silently conduct the audience as it rapped to his biggest hit, “Slow Jamz.”

Those problems overshadowed West’s efforts to put on an imaginative show. He brought with him Miri Ben-Ari, the incredible “hip-hop violinist” who played on West’s album, and she and the DJ took the crowd through violin versions of hits from Jay-Z, J-Kwon, and Jadakiss.

Legend, who has supplied vocals for some of West’s most soulful hooks, was a welcome addition when he could be heard.

The only downside that West could control was his overreliance on playing his hits with other artists. It was as if he needed to keep reminding listeners of his history as a producer.

Even before West came on, things looked bleak. The opener, Dilated Peoples, canceled at the last minute; Young Gunz were announced during the night as an opening act, but they never showed.

Local favorite 7L & Esoteric provided a brief but good set, followed by Skillz, who committed the cardinal sin of wearing a Yankees hat in front of a crowd that had been looking at a dark stage for 45 minutes.

But his powerful and seasoned stage presence, combined with clever punch lines, won him more than a few new fans.
