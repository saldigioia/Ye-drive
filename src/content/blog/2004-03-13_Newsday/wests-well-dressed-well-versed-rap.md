# West's Well-Dressed, Well-Versed Rap

At his concert in a midtown Manhattan nightclub, the rapper Kanye West would have been noticeable even if he hadn’t been on stage. He wasn’t sporting the typical hip-hop wardrobe of, say, a throwback or a doo-rag. Instead, West wore amber-colored sunglasses, a fusty knit sweater with a deer-hunting motif and a Louis Vuitton backpack. The closest comparison might be a hipper version of Carlton Banks, the preppy black son on the television show “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.”

Fashion wasn’t the only rap convention West shrugged off Thursday night. His outfit nodded wryly to hip-hop’s “backpackers,” a subgenre of anti- gangsta rappers such as Arrested Development and Common. But while West delivered some of rap’s most insightful rhymes, he’s no more a backpacker than a gun-toter. One moment he was fantasizing about beating and robbing a former employer, the next he was lampooning the empty materialism of black culture.

West is one of this year’s (and one of rap’s) most surprising success stories. The 26-year-old Chicagoan made his name producing hits for others, including Alicia Keys (“You Don’t Know My Name”) and Jay-Z (“’03 Bonnie and Clyde”). But his debut album, “The College Dropout,” on Jay-Z’s Roc- A-Fella label, is rarely tough or sexy. One song is about working at The Gap, another about God. Still, the colorful, head-bobbing beats and refreshingly smart rhymes pushed the disc to No. 2 on Billboard’s album chart.

West’s 50-minute performance was almost entirely free of rap clichs. He never asked the crowd to “make some noise,” encouraged anyone to “represent” their borough or pitted ladies against fellas in a shout-off. Instead, West tried to illuminate a number of complicated issues with his clever, conversational rhymes while a DJ played backing tracks and another musician supplied keyboards and soulful singing.

“We Don’t Care” featured a chorus of children celebrating their drug-dealing careers even as West pointed out that it’s just another dead-end job. “The drug game’s bulimic,” he noted. “It’s hard to get weight.” On “All Falls Down,” West posited that blacks wear flashy clothes to hide insecurities and shame over poverty. “We buy a lot of clothes when we don’t really need ‘em/Things we buy to cover up what’s inside,” he rapped. “We all self-conscious, I’m just the first to admit it.” The crowd sang along with every word’s response - signaling, perhaps, a sense of relief that someone finally said it.

West isn’t 100 percent performer yet; he still has a producer’s need for total control. He frequently fussed over his musicians, cutting off the keyboard player and giving his DJs cues they already knew. Often, he’d interrupt himself to explain the origin of a certain song or rhyme. Then again, West has a lot to say, and his unorthodox approach is part of what makes him so worth hearing.

West was the last of several emerging Roc-A-Fella artists on the bill, including soul singers Rell and Anthony Allen and rappers The Have Notz and Young Gunz. The thuggish Memphis Bleek and the agitated rapper Freeway briefly provided distinctive voices. But mostly, these overly familiar future acts seemed like the very reason that West is such a welcome change.
