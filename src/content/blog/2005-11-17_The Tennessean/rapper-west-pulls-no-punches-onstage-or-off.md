# Rapper West Pulls No Punches, Onstage or Off

## Show Comes to MTSU Tonight, and He Says It's a Sight to See

Rapper Kanye West’s tendency to express himself — with little if any restraint — pulls in an awful lot of attention.

It’s often the good kind, like the worldwide praise he received for an impassioned performance of hit Jesus Walks at Philadelphia’s Live 8 event. But sometimes it’s bad, too. His temper tantrum after a best-new-artist loss to country singer Gretchen Wilson at last year’s American Music Awards arguably received as much press as his Live 8 spot.

To Kanye West, this is just what makes him him.

“Yeah, is the word ‘uninhibited?’ The good and the bad,” he says, calling in from a stop on his current Touch The Sky tour, which hits Murfreesboro tonight. “The stuff people agree with and the stuff people don’t agree with, (that’s) what makes me. And when I’m onstage, I definitely give you all of that.”

West’s prowess onstage, true enough, consistently generates some of the most overwhelmingly positive attention the rapper gets. When he performed Jesus Walks at the 47th Grammy awards, CBS News called it “eye-popping” and USA Today praised how West “brought the house to its feet.”

The stage show for the Touch The Sky tour, West says, was built to do the same.

“We put a lot into the set design,” he says, the “we” also referring to respected European theater set designer Es Devlin, whom he brought on board for the tour. “I don’t wanna give away exactly what it is, because I want fans to come and say, ‘Ahhhh man, that’s crazy,’ when they see it, but it’s definitely theatrical, artistic and exciting at the same time. And it’s nothing you ever saw before, in any genre. It’s like a play or a roller coaster.”

Before West’s career as a rapper took off with his 2004 debut album, The College Dropout (which features Jesus Walks), the 28-year-old’s focused creativity brought him success as a producer for the likes of rap star Jay-Z and R&B singer Alicia Keys. Once West emerged from behind the scenes, though, he became a particularly vocal force in the entertainment world, drawing both praise and scorn for his outspokenness.

At Live 8, West publicly chided politicians for personal excess in the face of African poverty. And recently, following the events in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, West famously veered off script during an NBC fundraiser to chide President Bush.

To some, celebrities such as West have a responsibility to speak out that comes with the platform afforded by fame. But to West, that’s not the case; it’s just a personal choice.

“I think it’s (just) in me to do it,” he says. “When you’re in a position like this and you’re making music, your only true responsibility is to make good music. If you come out with one good album, when the fans come to buy that second album that needs to be good, too, because they really expect that from you. . . . We’re musicians, we’re not politicians. I don’t have a responsibility to make groundbreaking videos (either) — I could make regular videos with good songs behind them. But I really want to do that.”

West’s video for Jesus Walks wasn’t often called “regular.” It was, however, called 2005’s best male video by the MTV Video Music Awards. And according to West, the new video he’s directed for Heard ‘Em Say, from this year’s successful follow-up Late Registration, isn’t poised to be called “regular,” either.

“This video, I’m telling you right now. Brace yourself,” he says. “It is the best video of the year.”

That kind of confidence also has been a trademark of West’s career. And confidence, in part, spurred him to release the award-winning Jesus Walks as a single, despite, as he raps in the song, being told that “you can rap about anything except for Jesus / That means guns, sex, lies, video tapes / But if I talk about God my record won’t get played, huh?”

Issuing a song about Jesus into the often-unwelcoming mainstream, he says, wasn’t a tough decision, either.

“Because the song was ridiculously dope,” West says. “And I think that was all in God’s plan. When things come together, like this new Heard ‘Em Say video or the Jesus Walks record, all that is in God’s plan for me.

“I set out to make entertaining stuff for the world, and good music. And he kind of does the rest for me.”
