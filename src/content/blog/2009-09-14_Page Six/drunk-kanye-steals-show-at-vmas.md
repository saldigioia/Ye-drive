# ‘Drunk' Kanye Steals Show at VMAs

An apparently drunk Kanye West callously stole the spotlight from country superstar Taylor Swift last night, moments after she won at the MTV Video Music Awards.

Swift was giving her acceptance speech after copping the award for Best Female Video when West stormed onto the Radio City Music Hall stage, stole the microphone and dissed the beautiful young songbird, declaring that Beyoncé’s “Single Ladies [Put a Ring On It]” should have won.

“Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time!” the rap star blathered as boos filled the hall. “One of the best videos of all time!”

Before West rudely interrupted, Swift thanked fans for embracing her.

“I sing country music, so thank you so much for giving me the chance to win a VMA award,” the songstress said seconds before West stole her thunder.

Swift, who scored the upset victory with “You Belong With Me,” appeared shaken. She tried to finish her speech — but MTV had already killed the mike and moved to the next act.

The 19-year-old singer was back in the spotlight moments later with a performance of the winning hit that started on an F train at Bryant Park and ended atop a yellow cab outside Radio City. Swift completed her night of glory when Beyoncé won Video of the Year — then invited the country star on stage to complete her speech.

“I thought I couldn’t love Beyoncé more — and then tonight happened,” Swift said backstage.

“I was really excited because I had won the award and then I was excited because Kanye West was on the stage and then I wasn’t so excited anymore [after he stole the mike].”

West left before the show ended and posted an apology on his blog: “I’M SOOOOO SORRY TO TAYLOR SWIFT AND HER FANS AND HER MOM.”

West had been seen partying long before the VMAs began, gulping down an open bottle of Hennessy cognac on the red carpet.

Before calling Swift to the stage, Beyoncé recalled winning a VMA at age 17 with Destiny’s Child. “I remember how excited I was,” she said. “I’d like Taylor to come out and have her moment.”

Last night’s show began with Madonna and Janet Jackson paying tribute to the late Michael Jackson.

The VMAs ended with a trailer of “This Is It,” a compilation of Jacko’s final rehearsals that are being cut into a movie due for release on Oct. 28.
