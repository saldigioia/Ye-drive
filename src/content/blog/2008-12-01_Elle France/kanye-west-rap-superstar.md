# Kanye West, Rap Superstar

## He’s the Greatest, He’s the Most Beautiful, He’s the Most Hype! Florence Trédez Had the Chance to Meet the Immense Kanye West on the Occasion of the Release of His New Album.

## The UFO of Hip-Hop

At Bercy, he came out alone, in a beautiful, slightly melancholy set of distant planets and desolate landscapes. On stage, Kanye West, 31, the UFO of hip-hop, doesn’t always rap precisely, but he puts so much emotion and conviction into his lyrics and music that he pulverizes, like meteors, any potential criticism. At a listening session for his fourth and new album, organized in his presence for French journalists in a Parisian studio, the self-proclaimed “greatest artist in the universe” and rapper with the aura of a pop star does not hold back. Eyes closed, he raises his arms and beats time, possessed by his own sounds. One might bet that Kanye (Swahili for “the only one”), the most sought-after producer of the moment (“History” by Jay-Z, celebrating Obama’s victory, “American Boy,” by Estelle, it’s him), loves himself, but it’s more complicated than that.

## “There Are a Lot of Misunderstandings About Me”

“There are a lot of misunderstandings about me,” he says later, one-on-one. “I’ve always played a character like in Will Ferrell comedies, a very macho, slightly over-the-top guy, and that’s who I am, deep down. But I’m also a nice guy, and life isn’t a movie, I can’t play the jerk all day. There are a lot of misunderstandings about me, but I think people are starting to understand me better. And with my albums, I’m delivering something that is undeniably artistic.” And there he goes again. The rapper from Chicago, who never finished his art studies and especially never abused false modesty, is already comparing his daring new album to a work by Jeff Koons. And it’s true that one can only be moved by the raw, minimal beauty of these electro-pop songs, free of samples (though that’s his trademark) and crossed with tribal percussion and quasi-religious choirs that recount his breakup with his ex-fiancée, Alexis Phifer. “With her, it was like I was under the influence of a drug called love and I was addicted even though it wasn’t good for me,” he admits shyly. “I needed a detox cure to be clean again.”

## Neo-Rap

A record where you sing - is that still rap? “Yes, because there are rap beats that 50 Cent would approve of. I sang in the shower but until now, I was afraid people would say I sang badly. When my mother died, I took the plunge.” This album, also marked by the pain of having lost Donda in 2007, his mother who died following breast reduction surgery and liposuction, Kanye West speaks of as a “collection,” like a fashion designer. “Besides, my next album will be called ‘Winter-Spring-Summer-Fall’ and it will have twelve songs and four seasons, with three songs for each season,” he reveals. Nicknamed “Louis Vuitton Don” for the excellence of his outfits, the outspoken rapper created a mini shoe collection for the brand and already dreams of designing clothes, even homes. But for now, he will settle for his music career. “I’m at the top and I absolutely don’t intend to go back down. Can you imagine Apple, Nike or Vuitton crashing? With my personality, I can only be #1.”
