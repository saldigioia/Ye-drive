# “Runaway”

When Kanye West unveiled "Runaway" at this year's VMAs, it felt like a publicity stunt -- an expertly staged publicity stunt, but still. Filling up that show's titanic stage and raising his glass to the douchebags, Kanye gave this year's show its one water-cooler moment. An hour earlier, Taylor Swift had sung a vaguely condescending song about how Kanye was still an innocent, and yet here was Kanye reveling in the same flaws that had made him a natural pariah just a year earlier -- delighting in them, even. Those same wrongs, after all, helped him write this song.

And as the VMA moment fades into the rearview, "Runaway" is able to stand as just that: a song, and a seriously goddam good one at that. Lo and behold, the "Runaway" lyrics have nothing to do with Taylor. Instead, they read like an embarrassed retraction of all the bile he threw at an ex on 2008's musically masterful, ethically fucked 808s and Heartbreak. On that album, he had nothing but rage for the "stupid L.A. girl" who broke his heart. Here, he finally shows some of the self-awareness that comes with time: "I just blame everything on you/ At least that's what I'm good at." That endlessly requoteable chorus (alas, edited on the official stream) has legs, and Kanye's arrangement locates a warmth he's been missing lately. Lonely piano plinks gradually find company amid string whooshes and beautifully melodic puddles of bass. And after new buddy Pusha T gets done his gentle snarl of a guest verse, Kanye returns with the sort of heartbroken, resigned singsong, finally ripping away from the bravado he shows so well.
