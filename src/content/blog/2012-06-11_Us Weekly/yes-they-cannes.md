# Yes, They Cannes!

## Kardashian and West Defy Naysayers as They Flaunt Their Love

Not a single E! camera hovered about when Kim Kardashian took Kanye West by the hand for an intimate predawn stroll along the Old Port in Cannes on May 23. West was just off a private jet from London and the duo had already settled into their borrowed love nest, socialite Denise Rich’s 157-foot yacht on the French Riviera. The two caught up, wandering the streets until 7 A.M., cherishing quiet time before the inevitable flashbulb frenzy at that evening’s premiere of West’s short film, Cruel Summer. “It was my first time to Cannes. It was amazing!” Kardashian tells Us. “I loved it!”

Welcome to, as West might put it, the greatest romance of all time. When the fame-courting Twitter-oholics went public in April, it was dismissed by many as a stunt to distract from her messy split with Kris Humphries, 27. But all Google alerts aside, Kardashian, 31, and West, 35, “are the real deal,” says a confidant. “I’ve never seen her like this.” And now that West - who patiently pursued Kardashian through her makeups and breakups - has won over the woman he’s told friends is his “dream girl,” he’s playing for keeps. “He waited for Kim,” says a West pal. “He knows they’re meant to be.”

The couple proved to be a terrific team at his premiere’s Palm Beach bash. While West appeared visibly anxious about how the film he wrote and directed was received, “Kim leaned her head on his shoulder, and he kept brushing her cheek and kissing her,” says an attendee. Kardashian also beamed in a gown by Balmain, a West favorite. Being on the arm of a dapper Vogue darling has her “stepping up her game to become more chic, with his advice,” says a source close to the Sears shiller.

And Kardashian is giving her man a different kind of makeover. “She’s making him gentler,” a pal says of West, who has behaved erratically since his mom Donda’s sudden death in 2007. “He isn’t so intense now.” Quality time with the raucous, close-knit Kardashian clan has also helped, adds the source. “He loves them.”

The “Otis” rapper would like to officially join the family ASAP, says a source. “They’re seriously talking marriage,” says the West pal, “and yes, she would.” He’s also hot to start a spinoff family of their own. “Kanye says he can’t wait to see her carrying his child,” says the source. “He says she will look beautiful pregnant.” Just think ofthebabyclotb.es!
