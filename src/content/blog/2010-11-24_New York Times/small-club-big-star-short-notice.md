# Small Club, Big Star, Short Notice

It started, as all huge-star-in-tiny-Manhattan-club concerts must, with a ticket rush and a spike in Craigslist prices. In the middle of the story there was lots of pushing and shoving at the door followed by an hour and a half of celebrity spotting and electrifying music, and it ended with a bewildering rant: a classic Kanye West event, in other words, for the lucky few who got to see him perform late Tuesday night.

Tickets to the surprise show at the Bowery Ballroom, which celebrated Mr. West’s brand-new album, “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” went on sale at noon on Tuesday (for $100) and sold out instantly, driving secondary-market prices into the thousands. That only made ticket buyers feel privileged, or at least inexplicably lucky. Leslie Brown, a lawyer waiting in line, attributed her success in grabbing two tickets to her “persistent fingers” on Ticketmaster’s Web site between 11:59 a.m. and 12:09 p.m., when her transaction was completed.

Any semblance of a democratic marketplace disappeared, however, once those proud ticket holders  as well as assorted journalists and industry hangers-on  lined up around 9 p.m., and the celebrities, models and bodyguards started to mob around the door. For at least three hours any and every important-sounding industry affiliation was cited to impress the door staff, though after a while it didn’t seem to matter. “Def Jam don’t work here,” barked one of the bouncers after the record company’s name was invoked by a few too many line cutters.

Once inside they saw Diddy and Spike Lee up in the V.I.P. section, Mos Def weaving through the crowd in an elegant suit, and maybe they caught glimpses of Ivanka Trump and Q-Tip. Next to me three young men seemed to have lost their entire vocabulary except for the phrase “OhmygodIcan’tevenbelievethis.”

Mr. West, who came out at 12:35 a.m. in a black patterned jacket covered in gold buttons, was scheduled to play “Dark Twisted Fantasy” from beginning to end. And for the next 90 minutes that’s exactly what he did, speaking hardly a word between songs and spending as much time mugging superstar style for the crowd as he did hunched over his electronic gear like the studio obsessive that represents the other side of his musical personality. About three-quarters of the album’s credited guest stars showed up to play their parts: Rick Ross, Nicki Minaj, Pusha T, John Legend and some others, yes; Jay-Z, Chris Rock, Rihanna, no. And demonstrating Mr. West’s links to other genres, he was joined on many of the songs by Justin Vernon of the indie folk band Bon Iver, whose falsetto was processed through Mr. West’s signature Auto-Tune effects, making it seem both more mechanized and more human.

But like the line outside, the guest musicians, no matter how famous, were just part of the ritual, garlanding Mr. West’s own status as the head celebrity in charge; even Diddy, perhaps the most famous person in the room, was happily reduced to the role of a cheerleader, pumping his fists and shouting from the balcony. For Mr. West, who disappeared from public view after intruding on Taylor Swift at the MTV Video Music Awards in September 2009, the album, released by Roc-A-Fella/Def Jam, is a triumphant return, getting five of five stars from Rolling Stone and a perfect 10.0 from Pitchfork, and his performance at the Bowery reinforced his place as a beloved hit maker.

Any other star would have been satisfied with that, and said thank you, good night, God bless. Not Kanye West. As anyone who has seen his combative recent television appearances or read his revealing and erratic Twitter feed would know, no Kanye West performance  of any kind  is complete without a good helping of megalomania, and his victory lap at the Bowery Ballroom was no exception.

In an impassioned yet rambling nine-minute speech after he finished “Dark Fantasy” and a few abbreviated encores Mr. West acknowledged, “It has been an extremely hard year for me,” and offered his gratitude to the supportive news media (“I never thought I’d say this: I want to thank the magazines for perfect scores across the board,” he said); revealed himself to be a bean counter to rival any record-label sales rep (“We sold out in Chicago; they sold out at Best Buy on 14th Street,” he exclaimed); sympathized with former President George W. Bush (any man that has been so villainized and survived, Mr. West said, “deserves one moment of redemption”); and seemed to retract his apology to Ms. Swift, or at least show that his regret was not complete (“If I wasn’t drunk I would have been onstage longer”).

That was the coherent part. He continued with a more elliptical indictment of the news media and its need for scapegoats and villains. As a statement of his feelings it might have been messy and filled with contradictions. But as a performance it was pure star material. And no one budged until he was done.
