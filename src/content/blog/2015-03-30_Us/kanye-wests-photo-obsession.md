Selfies just won’t cut it for Kanye West. Before recent stops at Fashion Week in NYC, London and Paris with wife Kim Kardashian, 34, the self-proclaimed “creative genius” hired a personal photographer to document the pair’s every move. “The photog takes thousands of shots a day, and Kanye pores over almost all of them,” says a source close to the rapper, 37 — “He’ll point to a picture of himself standing at a desk and be like, ‘This will go down in history.’” While the snapper is in charge of the camera, West handles the wardrobe. “Kanye will breeze into a store and immediately start pulling looks for Kim to try on,” says the insider of the dad of 21-month-old daughter North. “He likes to pose her after he’s picked out her outfits. He gets completely in the zone.”
