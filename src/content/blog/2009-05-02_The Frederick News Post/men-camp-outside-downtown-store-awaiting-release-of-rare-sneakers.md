# Men Camp Outside Downtown Store, Awaiting Release of Rare Sneakers

About 10 men camped out Friday in front of Social Study on North Market Street in Frederick for today’s release of 10 Kanye West’s Nike Air Yeezy sneakers.

“It’s a great tennis shoe,” said Perry Brooks of Woodbridge, Va. “They’re very rare. If people see you have them on your feet, they’ll know you’re supreme in the tennis shoe market.”

Only about 2,000 pairs exist worldwide, said the store’s buyer, AJ Naylor. He wasn’t surprised to see the campers.

The colors this weekend are black and pink. Social Study released gray and orange Air Yeezy shoes on April 4. The store will release tan ones in June.

The shoes cost $250 a pair retail, but collectors will pay up to $1,000 for them, Brooks said.

Brooks said he probably has about 250 pairs of sneakers at home. He’s been hunkered down outside Social Study since Thursday afternoon. He bit into a hot dog and leaned back in a lawn chair.

He pointed out the men who arrived Wednesday. They were sleeping on makeshift beds.

They beat Brooks to the door, so he’s No. 8 on the waiting list.

That doesn’t bother him, he said. He already checked it out. He’s the only one with a size 13 foot, so he believes his odds of scoring a sneaker are pretty good.
