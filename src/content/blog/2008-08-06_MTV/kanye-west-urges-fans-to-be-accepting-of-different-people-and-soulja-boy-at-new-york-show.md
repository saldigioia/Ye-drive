# Kanye West Urges Fans to ‘Be Accepting of Different People’ — And Soulja Boy — At New York Show

## ‘Let People Be Who They Are,’ ‘Ye Says During Spirited End-of-Concert Rant.

NEW YORK — It’s Kanye Kammentary! The Chicago-bred superstar showed on Tuesday night that his voice is equally as captivating backed by music as it is without it. In fact, he doesn’t even have to rhyme. Days after his Lollapalooza appearance, West was back on his Glow in the Dark Tour and finished his show at New York’s Madison Square Garden with a speech about negative stereotypes and the need for diversity in hip-hop.

‘Ye started off giving props to Nas for his amazing achievements on the mic.

“Nas is the only MC of my generation — maybe Rakim, but he was the generation before me — Nas was the most respected MC in every genre of rap. Nigga, he could do a song with Puffy or Wu-Tang.”

Kanye then moved his analysis of hip-hop to the subject of Soulja Boy Tell’em, saying that the teen should be respected for not only making his own beats, but giving the people fun choruses, reminiscent of the hip-hop of yesteryear.

“How is Soulja Boy killing hip-hop?” Kanye asked, as some fans booed. “He had one of the biggest songs of the summer. If anything, he’s helping keep it alive. You don’t have to be Lil Wayne in order for people to say your sh— is fresh.

“Open y’all’s f—-in’ minds,” said West, who recently teamed up with MTV and put his outspoken nature to use helping veterans. “Be accepting of different people. Let people be who they are.”

He went from music to society in general, complaining that he’s been outcast for some of his beliefs.

“You know how many people came at me, calling me ‘gay’ cause I wear my jeans the fresh way?” he said to the audience. “Or ‘cause I said, ‘Hey, dude, how y’all gonna say ‘f—' right in front of a gay dude’s face and act like that’s OK?’ That sh— is disrespectful.

“It took me time to break out of the mental prisons I was in,” West added. “The stereotypes of the fear of the backlash that I would get for believing in what I believe in, for accepting people for who they are.”

Before he sent everyone home, West also took the opportunity to tell the people that he’s one of the kings of the stage right now.

“Thank y’all for listening to me,” the music icon said. “I had a few things to get off my chest. I want y’all to handle the rest. New York City, good night.”
