# Kanye West Reclaims Center Stage

Last Monday afternoon, an email summoned recipients to a loading dock in Manhattan’s Meatpacking District at 10 p.m.. There, jackhammer beats reverberated through garage doors open to the street as rain poured down. Inside, the crowd was peppered with hip-hop’s elite, including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, who beamed and called for the DJ to re-play a song that sampled Billie Holiday’s “Strange Fruit.”

The host, Kanye West, wasn’t on a stage, but as with everything he does, it was a performance. He grinned and bounced in place along the wall of a dark, crowded room with a pocked concrete floor. The music from his forthcoming album was pounding from big speakers and the image of an aircraft dropping bombs filled a wall-to-wall video screen. People thronged around him aiming camera phones as he rapped along with himself on the recording.

The party marked the public debut of the 36-year-old rapper’s sixth solo album, which is expected in stores Tuesday. Shrouded in secrecy for almost a year, the project was finished with 11th-hour assistance by veteran music producer Rick Rubin. Mr. West had turned in the album to his record label just a few days before Monday’s hastily arranged “listening session.”

With his genre-pushing sonics and epic-scale ambitions (the new album is titled “Yeezus,” a biblical twist on his nickname, Yeezy) Mr. West has again succeeded in making himself the focal point in a music landscape where most acts struggle to sustain more than a blip of broad attention.

He’s achieved that in part by opting out of almost everything marquee acts normally do to promote an album. He hasn’t released any of his new songs to radio stations. You can’t preorder “Yeezus” on Amazon or iTunes. And he has refused to put his new music videos on TV or online.

At Monday’s event, he said having YouTube display his videos next to other people’s would be like a store stocking Louis Vuitton next to lesser brands. “I don’t want to be in that context,” the rapper said while introducing his album to the crowd with a characteristically breathless and topic-hopping statement. “I got this new strategy: It’s called no strategy. I got an idea how to sell more music: It’s called make better music.”

His experiment will get its first test next week when “Yeezus” competes with albums released the same day by two ascendant rappers, J. Cole and Mac Miller. Mr. West may be at a disadvantage: With no new music to work with, radio stations have played his older songs 14,000 times in the last month, according to Nielsen. By contrast, J. Cole has racked up 43,000 “spins” during the same period, thanks to two strong singles.

Even without a hit like “Power,” “Gold Digger” or other singles that announced Mr. West’s past albums, he isn’t wanting for exposure. The uncompromising artist has a parallel existence in the celebrity tabloids because of his relationship with reality TV queen Kim Kardashian, who is pregnant with their child.

Mr. West previewed his new music one month ago on the season finale of “Saturday Night Live.” Veiled in darkness on stage, he performed some of his most strident and confrontational material yet, including a screed against racism and greed called “New Slaves.”

That weekend, he also triggered a guerrilla marketing campaign by projecting a “New Slaves” video on the side of buildings in 66 cities; hundreds more locations would follow.

Despite the apparent cohesion of that introduction, the rest of Mr. West’s album was still in flux. After the “SNL” performance he sought out Mr. Rubin. “We ended up listening to three hours of partially finished pieces,” said the producer via email. “The raw material was very strong but hadn’t yet come into focus. Many of the vocals hadn’t been recorded yet, and many of those still didn’t have lyrics.” At the time he figured it would take “several months” to finish the album, yet it was due in three weeks to Def Jam.

As Mr. West homed in on an aggressive, minimalist sound in the studio, he delivered a clutch performance on a recent Sunday, squeezed into a session between Ms. Kardashian’s baby shower and an evening flight to Milan. Mr. Rubin said, “Five songs still needed vocals and two or three of them still needed lyrics. He said, ‘Don’t worry, I will score 40 points for you in the fourth quarter.’ In the two hours before he had to run out to catch the plane, he did exactly that.”

Raised in Chicago, Mr. West first broke out as a producer. In the early ‘00s he shaped signature hits for Jay-Z, who signed him as a behind-the-scenes beatmaker. Few people took Mr. West seriously as a rapper (an underestimation he would later mythologize in song). Rob Stone, co-founder of music magazine the Fader, recalled the budding lyricist visiting his office in 2003 and quietly asking him to put on a CD. He then rapped “voraciously” over the instrumentals for a song he wrote after a serious car crash, “Through the Wire,” which would become his first solo hit. Mr. Stone says, “He was performing as if he was in front of 20,000 people but there was only four of us in the room.” That display earned Mr. West his first magazine cover.

Since the release of his debut, “The College Dropout,” his albums have sold a combined 13.4 million U.S. copies, according to Nielsen. His most recent solo album, “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” was a critics’ favorite of 2010.

Once known for knotty rhyme schemes and samples of old soul songs, Mr. West has adopted elongated rhymes, half-singing and raw shrieks on “Yeezus,” which features industrial beats and foreboding drones reminiscent of Pink Floyd. Absorbing the music at the “Yeezus” party and watching Mr. West silently--it was too deafening for conversation--were rappers who blazed trails of their own 20 years ago, including Busta Rhymes and Q-Tip.

When the music ended, Mr. West talked about the album some more. Then, as people began trickling out onto the rainy street, he started playing “Yeezus” again from the beginning.
