# No Reading and Writing, but Rapping Instead

A petulant rapper and producer named Kanye West has created 2004’s first great hip-hop album. “The College Dropout” (Roc-A-Fella) will be released tomorrow and it is, among other things, a concept album about quitting school, a playful collection of party songs and a 76-minute orgy of nose-thumbing.

The album begins with a high school teacher asking Mr. West to deliver a graduation speech, “something for the kids.” So he starts into a slightly unhinged (but totally addictive) singsong refrain: “All my people that’s drug dealing just to get by, stack your money till it gets sky-high/We wasn’t supposed to make it past 25, joke’s on you, we still alive.” He uses his casual voice to describe a world of dope and dyslexia, and when he raps, “Hold up, hold fast, we make mo’ cash/Now tell my momma I belong in that slow class,” it is clear that he has been waiting for this moment for a long time.

Until recently Mr. West was known primarily as a producer, not a rapper. He composed five songs on Jay-Z’s great 2001 album “The Blueprint,” pioneering an approach that is literally soulful: he likes to borrow bits of 1970’s soul records, often speeding up the vocals so they are recognizable but not quite familiar.

During the last few months Mr. West has scored an astonishing series of successes, establishing himself as hip-hop’s leading producer, at least for the moment. His current hits include “Stand Up” by Ludacris, “You Don’t Know My Name” by Alicia Keys and “Encore” by Jay-Z, as well as “Slow Jamz,” a collaboration with Twista (a slightly modified version appears on this album), and “Through the Wire,” Mr. West’s breakthrough solo single.

“Through the Wire,” which appears near the end of “The College Dropout,” borrows a chorus from Chaka Khan and a plotline from real life: in October 2002 Mr. West came close to dying in a car accident. With his jaw still wired shut (or so he says) he recorded the mush-mouthed lyrics. “My dogs couldn’t tell if I/Would look like Tom Cruise in ‘Vanilla Sky,’ “ he slurs, slipping into character as a wounded hero beating the odds. For about a year the song circulated on Mr. West’s mixtapes, unofficial releases that gave him a chance to prove that he was the exception to the rule that producers can’t rap.

He still doesn’t have the smoothest flow, but he compensates by overstuffing his stanzas with sharp jokes and witty references, sometimes doubling back to correct or contradict himself. In “Breathe In, Breathe Out,” a stripped-down club track with a chorus by Ludacris, Mr. West laughs at his ambivalence: “Always said if I rapped, I’d say something significant/But now I’m rapping ‘bout money, hoes and rims again.” And “Jesus Walks,” a gospel song with a clever choral arrangement and a trudging military beat, would not be quite so exciting if the first verse didn’t offer a nonjudgmental portrait of a crack dealer.

This album is not quite perfect: a barrage of skits near the end ruins the momentum, and it seems no one was able to persuade Mr. West not to end his debut with a rambling nine-minute monologue about how he got a record deal. (A fascinating story, once.)

But it is close. Mr. West delights in the unexpected and the unlikely: pro-black slogans rub up against pickup lines; the Boys Choir of Harlem harmonizes with the frenetic violinist Miri Ben-Ari; Marvin Gaye and Michael Bolton provide equally effective samples. “Family Business,” a gorgeous tribute to the pleasures and frustrations of family life, coasts along on a wistful piano loop but ends with a kick in the teeth: a child says, “Let’s get Stevie out of jail.”

Throughout the album Mr. West taunts everyone who didn’t believe in him: teachers, record executives, police officers, even his former boss at the Gap. This album is payback, all but guaranteed to debut near the top of the charts. As he puts it, “I was almost famous/Now ‘Everybody Loves’ Kanye — I’m almost Raymond.” If the album is a success, Mr. West may have to brush some of those chips off his shoulder and adjust to life as a front-runner, not an underdog. O.K., he got even. Now what?
