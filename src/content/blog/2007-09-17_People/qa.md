# Q&A

## â€œCreate Buzz. Cause Excitement. That's What I'm Here to Do. That's My Job"

With his CD Graduation and work for "ED in '08," a campaign to reform public schools, Kanye West is out to make a difference. He talked with Sarah Preston about his fall agenda.

**Your new CD hits stores the same day as 50 Cent's. He said if you outsell him, he'll give up his solo career.**

I hope he wouldn't because he's one of my favorite rappers. That'll be a reason for me to move the date.

**You were nominated for five VMAs. The show airs Sept. 9. Feeling lucky?**

No. Justin [Timberlake] had the year of his life. Some people walking amongst us are just doing things a little bit greater than others ... and Justin is one of them. [But] it's good to have somebody who you look at and say, "Let me see if I can outdo him."

**With your program Loop Dreams, you want to teach hip-hop in schools. But how do you deal with the violent lyrics and themes?**

If you have a poetry class or a literature class, there's usually something bad happening, somebody died. This person's conquering this person ... this person got killed here. That's what hip-hop is about. Kids don't listen to 50 Cent and say, "I'm going to kill somebody." They know that it's fictional.

**You're engaged to designer Alexis Phifer. Made any plans?**

No, but when I plan 'em, I'll be sure not to tell anyone.
