# Central Park West

As its Live in Central Park fashion extravaganza approaches next Wednesday, H&M has offered up a new tidbit on its rather secretive plans. After sending out its cryptic “Save the Date” invitation in February, alerting press of the event but remaining mum on the particulars, the company is now said to have found its headlining entertainment act for the show: Kanye West, the three-time Grammy-winning, rapper and 27-year-old producer. His latest effort, “The College Dropout,” has sold millions of records and landed him on Time Magazine’s “100 Most Influential People” list this week, where he keeps company with Condoleeza Rice, Karl Rove, Martha Stewart and Oprah Winfrey. West will be performing after H&M’s massive fashion show, which will feature 150 models — who knew there were 150 models for hire?
