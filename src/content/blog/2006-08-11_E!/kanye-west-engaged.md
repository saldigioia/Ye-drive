# Kanye West Engaged

We ain’t saying she’s a gold digger, but Kanye West is far from broke.

And now, far from single.

The six-time Grammy-winning rapper-producer has popped the question to his girlfriend, Alexis, People reported Friday on its Website.

Details are sketchy. The “Jesus Walks” emcee reportedly proposed during a recent two-week-long overseas vacation, but it’s not known exactly where or when the knee-bending went down, or when the betrotheds will tie the knot..

Likewise, the future Mrs. West is a something of a mystery. We don’t know her last name, age or occupation.

Calls to West’s publicist were not immediately returned.

But, per People, West and his fiancee rekindled her romance with the hip-hopster after two years apart.

The couple previously dated for several years, with Alexis reportedly by his side prior to the 2002 near-fatal car wreck that left the rapper with a wired jaw. In a 2004 interview with Blender, the College Dropout artist announced he had split from his lady love in August of that year.

“The thing is, I always had a girlfriend,” he told the magazine. “Now it’s like some property opening up on the beach that no one could get into until now.”

Guess the ladies should consider that beach re-closed.

While it’s unknown when the two reconnected, it couldn’t have been too long ago.

As recently as April, West was dating 24-year-old MTV assistant-turned-model Brooke Crittenden, whom, he told Rolling Stone, he had been with for more than a year.

“I don’t think we’ve ever been apart longer than seven days,” she told the New York Daily News. “I trust him. He’s got so much going on, but he never makes me feel like number two.”

Okay.

Prior to coupling with Crittenden, West was linked in the gossip pages with the likes of American Idol winner Fantasia Barrino and even the recently married Pamela Anderson, though neither pairing was ever confirmed.
