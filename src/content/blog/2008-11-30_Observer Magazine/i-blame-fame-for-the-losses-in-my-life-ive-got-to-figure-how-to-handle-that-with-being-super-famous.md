# “I Blame Fame for the Losses in My Life. I’ve Got to Figure How to Handle That, With Being Super-Famous”

## When Kanye West’s Mother Unexpectedly Died Last Year, He Was Devastated. Then He Split Up With His Fiancee. His Answer? An Emotionally Explosive New Album. Luke Bainbridge Goes on the Road With Hip-Hop’s Hottest Star

It seems longer than 18 months since I last spoke to Kanye West. So much has happened in that time it must seem like a lifetime to him. Last summer he was putting the finishing touches to his third album. “Graduation” was released on the same day as the latest album by 50 Cent, then the best-selling hip-hop artist in the world, and they posed for the cover of Rolling Stone as title fighters. West delivered a surprising knock-out blow, outselling Fiddy by 957,000 copies to 691,000 and topping the charts on both sides of the Atlantic.

He has always been a much more intriguing and complex, occasionally contradictory, proposition than his peers. His background - born in Chicago, he’s the son of a university professor and a former Black Panther - and his “Preppy” image set him apart from other urban artists. His steely ambition and drive is such that he recorded his debut single “Through The Wire” in hospital, with his mouth wired partly shut, after a near-fatal car crash. He’s notoriously arrogant, once claiming he’d be a leading character in the Bible if it was rewritten: “You don’t think I would be one of the characters of today’s modern Bible?” He’s as famous for his outbursts as he is for his music. When he didn’t win best video at the MTV European Awards in 2006 he stormed the stage, shouting “Fuck this! My thing cost a million dollars man… I had Pam Anderson, I was jumping across canyons and shit. If I don’t win, the award show loses… credibility.” Even those who don’t know his music will recall him speaking out against the outgoing president, when he appeared on live TV for a Hurricane Katrina benefit concert. West went off message and declared: “George Bush doesn’t care about black people.”

Following earlier hits such as the Shirley Bassey-sampling “Diamonds From Sierra Leone,” “Gold Digger,” and “Stronger,” and an unrivalled succession of production credits for everyone from Alicia Keys to Jay-Z, the success of “Graduation” put the multi-Grammy-winning, multi-million-selling West right at the top of his game. Exactly where he told us he should be from day one. Then came the double heartbreak. Or the “Shakespearean tragedy,” as he calls it. “That’s what this is,” he tells me, “it’s a modern-day tragedy.”

An only child (Kanye is Ethiopian for “the only one”), West was raised mainly by his doting mother Donda, who deemed him “destined for greatness from an early age.” A former chairwoman of Chicago State University’s English Department, she later managed her son’s businesses and chaired the Kanye West Foundation. He called her his “momager.” When I spent six months with him on and off for Observer Music Monthly, she was rarely far from his side. She was there at his 30th birthday party in Manhattan last June, there when he stole the show at the Concert for Diana at Wembley in July 2007, and they turned out together in New York and London for signings of her book, “Raising Kanye: Life Lessons from the Mother of a Hip-hop Superstar.” They were as tight as a son and mother could be. He wrote a song for her called “Hey Mama”; and she used it as the ringtone on her cellphone.

On Saturday 10 November 2007, Donda West died due to complications from cosmetic surgery. Reports suggested another Beverly Hills physician had advised her not to have the surgery. Kanye was in London when he heard and rushed back to the States. But the following Saturday he was back on stage in Paris. When he started to introduce “Hey Mama,” he cracked. “This song is for my mother…” he started, before his voice faltered and he stood alone, head bowed, sobbing in the spotlight, before being led off stage by members of his band.

Jay-Z, Beyonce, Pharrell Williams, Erykah Badu, and others turned up to pay tribute at Donda’s funeral where West reportedly broke down as he gave a short speech. Two days later he was back on stage at the O2 arena in London. On 10 January 2008, the Los Angeles County Coroner concluded that Donda West died of “coronary artery disease and multiple post-operative factors due to or as a consequence of liposuction and mammoplasty.”

Then, in April, West split with his fiancee, designer Alexis Phifer. They had dated on and off since 2002, and were engaged in Capri in August 2006. “It’s always sad when things like this end… we remain friends,” Phifer said. “I wish him the best in his future and all of his endeavors. He’s one of the most talented people I’ve ever met.” An oddly worded statement that sounds more like a reference for an ex-colleague than regret over the loss of a soulmate.

West, meanwhile, was embarking on his global “Glow In The Dark” tour. In Japan last year, before all the heartbreak, he had explained to me how he had always struggled to set a mood that suited him in the studio until he tried putting neon lights in there. “Now I know my mood is neon…” he said. “I AM neon…”

You are neon? I repeated.

“I. Do. Glow. In. The. Dark.”

The ambitious set placed West alone in the middle of the stage, his band removed to a pit in front. If that were not prescient enough, the plot behind the show’s concept saw West marooned in space when his spaceship crashed.

The first proper indication of where West’s head was at, musically and emotionally, was his guest appearance on Young Jeezy’s single “Put On,” back in June. His voice cracked and distorted by Auto-Tune - a vocoder gadget widely adopted in hip-hop recently (although OM readers may recall Cher using it on her 1998 number one single, “Believe”). “I lost the only girl in the world that know me best,” poured out West in a cracked ephemeral pitch. “I got the money and the fame and it don’t mean shit… man, the top is so lonely.” His voice twisted and stretched like never before, he moaned “I-I-I-I-I-I-‘m so lonely.”

After touring for six months through North America, South America, and Asia, the Glow In The Dark tour finally arrived in the UK this month. I flew out to Dublin to see the show before it arrived in England. It’s a hugely ambitious show, but the most poignant point came halfway through when West, dripping with sweat and alone on stage, expanded his “Put On” verse into a long, impassioned rant about the vacuousness of celebrity and the gaping chasm in his personal life. “I lost my mom, I lost my girl, I lost the only things that matter,” he spat, the words bouncing around the huge venue and straight over the heads of the audience, “but at least it’s fun,” he added sadly, “that I can get you to say, ‘Hell, yeah!’”

“Hell, yeah!” hollered back the young crowd, oblivious to the pathos.

Two days later, when we meet in West’s favourite London hotel, The Landmark, it’s a year and a day since his mother passed. He walks into the suite wearing a Raf Simons jacket, Retro Super Future shades, a thick Louis Vuitton scarf, and shoulder bag. He politely but firmly refuses to remove his shades, scarf, or shoulder bag for the photoshoot. When we sit down to talk, he removes the bag and scarf, but the shades remain in place. He talks more quietly than usual. In the 36 hours since Dublin, West has been to Paris for meetings with Louis Vuitton about the shoe range he is designing for the label. The self-christened Louis Vuitton Don is also working on his own fashion label, Pastelle, and counts designers such as Kim Jones as close friends. “I’m like the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary,” he rapped on “Graduation.” He’s only had a couple of hours’ sleep in the past two days and is so exhausted that when I listen back to the interview later he sounds drunk, slurring his words.

His new album is entitled “808s & Heartbreak,” and is steeped in both. The 808 is the Roland TR-808, a drum machine beloved of early dance-music pioneers. The heartbreak seeps through every song, with titles such as “Welcome to Heartbreak,” “Love Lockdown,” “See You In My Nightmares,” “Heartless,” “Paranoid,” “Bad News,” and “Coldest Winter.”

His previous albums, “College Dropout,” “Late Registration,” and “Graduation” have been a masterful mix of artful intentions and mainstream appeal, somehow straddling the hoods and suburbs. “Heartbreak” is a complete departure. An incessant tweaker, West used to spend up to 18 months working on an album. Last year he worked with eight engineers around the world on “Stronger” alone, recording more than 50 versions. “Heartbreak” more or less poured out of him in one studio in a mere three weeks. He hardly raps on it; almost every vocal has the ghostly Auto-Tune effect with West half-singing, half-speaking, and there’s none of the skits that littered previous albums. It’s quite a break from his opening trilogy.

“Yeah, it definitely is,” nods West. “It was just a brand new idea. It was like these are the sounds, these are the instruments I want to use and “Yeah, it definitely is,” nods West. “It was just a brand new idea. It was like these are the sounds, these are the instruments I want to use and this is the subject matter.”

Previously he would ensure there was something for all his fans, a concession he no longer feels he needs to make.

“Now I just make music for me. It’s like my house, because it’s where I have to live. It’s what I have to perform, 100 shows a year. So people may comment on it to their friends, but when they try and make a suggestion to me, it’s like suggesting I change the couch in my living room - ‘Fuck you, it’s my couch.’ I’m just allowing people in my home… if you don’t like it, you can leave.”

Which came first, the 808s or heartbreak?

“The music, then I came up with the title because I was taking an 808 and pitching it. A lot of people have used 808s in the past but because it was so low, nobody bothered messing with the pitch. I actually call the effect ‘heartbreak’. It sounds distorted and electronic, and just the sound of it represents where I’m at.”

“I’ve created a new genre for myself called ‘pop art,’” he continues. “I know they have that genre of visual art but they don’t have it in music. Either call it ‘pop’ or ‘pop art’, either one I’m good with.”

Do you think people will be shocked by Heartbreak? “They’ll definitely be surprised it’s so personal and so heartfelt. It was just pouring out of my soul. It was therapeutic…”

To get the hurt out of your system? “Well, to try my best. To scream at the top of my lungs about what I’m going through.”

Previously, West told me he thought proper rock stars settle down and have kids. On Heartbreak he morosely recounts how “My friend showed me pictures of his kids, but all I could show him was pictures of my cribs.” This is not exactly typical hip-hop lyrical fodder, Kanye.

“Especially for me,” nods West. “How many times have I had songs just about what I’ve bought blah, blah, and now it’s like - take all that away and what do you have?”

Do you think it will polarise your fanbase?

“Definitely. Some people just want to hear a lot of rap lyrics. I’m just trying to make the best music possible. I’ll use the advantage of being a rapper to give an urban flavor to pop hits, which is an incredible combination. That chorus to ‘Heartbreak’ could be a Broadway chorus, it’s so classic,” he says. “In the night, I hear ‘em talk, the coldest story ever told, somewhere far along this road he lost his soul, to a woman so heartless - the message is classic. The heartbreak. The Shakespearian tragedy. That’s what this is - it’s a modern-day tragedy. Devastation. Multiple losses in my life.”

You’ve always been a control freak, but you must have felt you had no control over what’s happened in the past year. 

“Yeah, but it helped me grow as a person. To have things that were out of my control and to have to accept those things. I’m less judgmental now, I think.”

Has it forced you to re-evaluate your beliefs?

“Yeah,” he says softly. “Well, my beliefs… I don’t partake to any specific religion, I just believe in God. I always had a problem with the specifics of religion. Like having to go to church on the third Sunday and eat the cracker and drink the wine…”

On College Dropout you said God was the executive producer of your life. Do you still feel like that? “Yeah, I feel like he has a path for me. I let him guide me. I open my mouth in the studio and let him say what he wants me to say, because I’m sure this music, even though it’s gut wrenching, is going to help people get through their situations. You know we talked last time about being the soundtrack to people’s lives? Well, really, that’s what it is.”

“Yeah,” he nods, “because people go through heartbreak and then people have a good time.”

So, the personal heartbreak - is it harder to deal with in the public, or weirdly cathartic?

“It’s weird, it’s kind of therapeutic… but to have to answer all these questions… it’s hard.”

But you’re obviously going to be asked about it because it’s the theme of the album.

“Yeah, they’re going to ask them a little more because of the songs, but the full explanation is in the songs… the little things here and there, I don’t really have to clarify them.”

We continue a little longer, but West’s head is dropping behind the shades. “Yo, I need to take a nap. I’m just falling asleep. You’re trailing with us today, right? We can talk some more later.” He curls up on the sofa and I leave the room.

After West wakes up we travel in a convoy of people carriers to tonight’s gig at the O2 arena. Before the gig, Kanye hosts a playback of the album for a select group of journalists. He is re-energized on hearing the music and more bullish when he answers a few questions. Most of the journalists are a little taken aback by the curveball that is Heartbreak. It’s either very brave or very foolish, one suggests - are you prepared for a backlash? “Yeah, I’m prepared,” retorts West. “For anyone who doesn’t like it, fuck you in advance.”

Asked about the heartbreak he says: “It’s lonely at the top. Losing my mom, having no woman in my life to support me. I feel I’m on my own and can only express it through my music.”

After the gig, he unwinds backstage by taking on Damon Albarn at Connect 4, another one of his quirky obsessions.

The following lunchtime we meet just off Leicester Square. West picks up a sandwich from Subway before we head into Capital for some pre-recorded interviews for radio. He’s asked again about the album’s themes. “I’m not going to Oprah Winfrey the situation, y’know what I’m saying?” he says. “I’ve dealt with a lot of fucked-up shit in my life and my heart, and I’m not a celebrity, I’m a real person and people don’t realize what that’s like.”

Partly in an attempt to open a straight dialogue with fans and bypass the media, West has also launched his own blog. He posts up to 10 times a day, a mixture of pictures of contemporary architecture, pieces from his favorite clothing designers, scantily clad models - usually with a speech bubble saying, “Where are you Yeezy?” - videos and the odd MP3. He thinks the blog “saved me a whole bunch of money,” reasoning that instead of spending millions on several homes, a fleet of cars and a trophy wife to prove his taste and success like a traditional pop star, he can simply showcase his impeccable taste on his blog. Occasionally, when he feels particularly misrepresented, there’ll also be a BREATHLESS RANT IN CAPITALS WITHOUT ANY PUNCTUATION AGAINST SOME PLAYER HATERS WHO DON’T UNDERSTAND THAT YE GIVES IT ALL FOR HIS FANS EVERY NIGHT!!!

Leaving Capital, on the way to Radio One, I’m invited to ride with West in his car to carry on the interview. Which is a little difficult when I’m in the front and he’s sat behind me with Virgil Abloh, a designer who is showing him images on a laptop.

So you’ve fallen out of love with fame, I suggest. “Yeah,” he nods, “it’s weird, it’s always been a love-hate thing. But now I blame fame for the losses of my life. In the future, I’ve got to figure how to handle that, with being super-famous.”  

You no longer want to be the biggest star in the world? “I’m completely fine with somebody else being the biggest star. I don’t need that. I just need to be expressive in my own right. I’m still going to do what I do and if by default that’s the biggest thing then it is, but it’s not my goal.”

We talk about Obama’s victory.  

“It was the most unbelievable thing in the world,” says West. “So incredible, so unimaginable, that America picked him. Especially after the Al Gore thing, where he got all those votes and still didn’t win.”

He’s written a song with Jay-Z inspired by Obama, called “History,” which has been leaked online, but already seems tired of being asked about it. “The thing about Barack is that any question that you can ask has already been answered,” he says.  “Barack’s win is like a comfortable silence. Whenever I think of the shit that is going on in my life, I just think of Barack and it makes everything seem OK.”

Kanye has already met Obama. “I met him with my mom in Chicago…”

“I would definitely like to be cool with the president,” West concludes, after a while. “I would just like to hoop with him. Everything else we can talk about on the court.”

Two days later West is arrested after an incident with a paparazzi outside Tup Tup Palace nightclub in Newcastle. The next day, after posting pictures of the new Aston Martin One-77, Peruvian model Stephanie Cayo, a diving mask with built-in camera, new work by Beijing artist Li Wei and new Air Jordans, West blogs “WHO’S WINNING ME OR THE MEDIA? NO MATTER HOW MUCH LIGHT I PUT OUT, THERE ARE PEOPLE WORKING JUST AS HARD TO ONLY DELIVER DARKNESS.” He continues: “LET US NOT FORGET THE PAPS KILLED PRINCESS DIANA.”

Almost all of the comments in response are positive, but some of West’s fans seem a little concerned for his mental state. So much so that he feels the need to respond. “THANKS EVERYBODY FOR YALL SUPPORT! I’M ACTUALLY DOING REALLY GOOD AND I’M INSPIRED AND CREATIVE RT NOW!. . . NO MORE TWELVE MINUTE MISERY FREESTYLES LOL!!!”

So what becomes of Ye, brokenhearted? He talks about taking six months off from music and going to work in a fashion house, giving himself some time off. “It’s like, I’d much rather talk about making this collar red,” he said in the car, pointing at a polo shirt on the laptop screen, “than answer your questions right now.”

He also talks about leaving LA and possibly moving to Europe. What doesn’t seem in doubt is that he blames fame and success, and hence himself, for what happened over the past year.

“I feel like I moved to California, then my mom moved to California,” he said, “and she did stuff she wouldn’t have done if we’d stayed in Chicago. If I’d never made it in the music business, it never would have happened.”
