# Curtis vs. Kanye

## Who Will Emerge Victorious in a Battle of Rap 

Since Kanye West and 50 Cent both confirmed a Sept. 11 release date for their new albums, retailers, rap fans and bloggers have whipped themselves into a frenzy over who’ll sell more units. And the battle was pure. That is, until Kenny Chesney confused matters by announcing the same date.

Still, the Ches isn’t talking as crazy as either 50 or West. 50 recently told sohh.com that if West outsells him, he’ll quit the rap game. West answered sarcastically — from another country, of course — that he really likes 50’s music and would hate for him to stop rhyming once his own “Graduation” sells more than 50’s “Curtis.”

Indeed, the weeks leading up to major hip-hop releases are always rife with wild statements and publicity stunts. (Was it a coincidence 50 Cent’s crew was involved in a shoot-out with the Game’s outside R&B/hip-hop WQHT [Hot 97] New York right before “The Massacre” dropped.)) But I doubt retailers care if this media circus is contrived — they just want consumers buying some product.

So, let’s lay the numbers side by side for 50 and West. Before we get started, I must clarify that while 50’s been using the term “international sales” quite a bit lately, Nielsen Sound Scan doesn’t monitor those. Therefore, I’m only utilizing numbers from American retailers.

In 2003, 50 Cent’s debut, “Get Rich or Die Tryin’,” sold 872,000 units its first week and has moved nearly 7.7 mil. lion. West’s 2004 debut, “The College Dropout,” sold 441,000 units its debut week and is just shy of 3 million overall. 50’s 2005 sophomore album, “The Massacre,” sold a mammoth 1.14 million units out of the gate and is at 5.1 million so far. Later that year, West’s “Late Registration” bowed with 860,000, and its total is now at 2.82 million. It’s important to remember that the consumer market in 2003 was much different from that in 2005. Folks still willingly went to Best Buy for CDs, where now it’s a veritable struggle to pry kids away from iTunes and file-sharing applications.

50 Cent has been more successful on the Billboard singles charts, with seven top 10 hits to West’s four on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and seven top 10 hits to West’s three on The Billboard Hot 100. I only counted the songs each artist has as a solo so “Hate It or Love It” by the Game featuring 50 Cent isn’t included, and neither is Twista’s “Slow Jamz” featuring West.

Contextually, it’s obvious that 50 may be through with rapping. After a questionable BET Awards performance, which left his audience staring blankly as he walked around, and releasing several singles/videos (“Follow My Lead,” “Ayo Technology,” “Amusement Park”) that didn’t garner the immediate and significant chart response he’s accustomed to, he just doesn’t seem excited. In fact, he appears to be grudgingly reassessing this year’s consumers.

“Generally, I can be a little more complex than where we are right now,” 50 Cent told onsmash.com in a video interview. “So I got to simmer down, so [my music’s] actually acceptable to the public. You got artists who’s records are working like ‘Ay Bay Bay’ … it doesn’t take a lot of lyrical ability to make those records. But this is just the climate of what’s going on now in the art form. I’ll go straight toward making the chorus. I’ve got a hit record where I don’t even say the chorus.”

But then again, 50’s reliable marketing formula casts him as the underdog and now that he’s an international superstar, it’s not working so well. So perhaps all the jiggered release dates, squelched singles and destroyed office TVs will give hip-hop fans the angry 50 they miss. And maybe, just maybe, life’s giving 50 his best marketing plan yet: implosion. Perhaps this will force the Queens, N.Y., rapper to resharpen his tools while fans holler that he’s past his expiration date.
