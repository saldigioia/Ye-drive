# Kanye West Shows His Studio Stuff Onstage

Hordes of hip-hop fans stood on their feet, pumped their fists in the air and screamed "Jesus Walks" from the top of their lungs Wednesday night at the Pageant. And even more incredible, it wasn't a Christian hip-hop concert.

But that was the scene at the packed Kanye West show, a fulfillment of a dream for West. In the lyrics to that spiritual march, the Chicago rapper/producer dreams of a time when folks are in clubs chanting the song's title. That time is now.

It was one of the special moments in West's fast-moving hourlong concert. West, a bona fide hitmaker for others whose own CD, "The College Dropout," has sold a million copies, showed that his skills (interesting lyrics, succinct delivery, newfangled beats) translate to the stage - untested grounds for him until now.

West, accompanied by a DJ, keyboardist/vocalist and guitarist, walked out to one of his productions for another, Jay-Z's "Takeover," and struck poses in one of his trademark blazers, the only rapper who'd wear one onstage.

Opening blast "This Way" was performed with support act Dilated Peoples (the song comes from the group's "Neighborhood Watch" CD) and started the concert running high. Next came a double dose of West-produced power hits, Ludacris' "Stand Up," with a new verse, and Talib Kweli's "Get By."

But West's own hits - such as "Slow Jamz" (with a new verse and preceded by West's vocalist's interpretation of Luther Vandross' "A House Is Not a Home"), "Through the Wire" and "All Falls Down" - were just as strong and exemplified his signature style of utilizing old, sped-up soul samples.

He gave a new twist to Alicia Keys' "You Don't Know My Name," another of his productions. He retitled it "I Still Don't Know Your Name," added new lyrics and included her cell-phone skit.

Non-hit album cuts such as "I'll Fly Away," "Spaceship" and "School Spirit" and a name-that-tune segment helped wrap things up, cemented by the part-rapped, part-spoken "Last Call."

The duo Young Gunz opened with songs from its debut CD, "Tough Luv."
