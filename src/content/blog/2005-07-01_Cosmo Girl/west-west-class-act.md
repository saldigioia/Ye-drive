# West West: Class Act

Chicago is famous for deep-dish pizza and Da Bears, but Kanye West is the town’s crowning glory! Here, he took a break from working on his new album, Late Registration, to share the secrets of his success.

1. Set goals. 

“If your goal is ‘I want to buy this car at the end of the year,’ you’ll have no problem waiting at the bus stop in the cold for 30 minutes. You’ll have no problem working eight hours a day. ‘Cause your bigger goal is so much higher than the small things you have to get over.”

2. Find a role model.

“My mother and father taught me that I could do anything. My grandfather Buddy was also a great role model. He drove a car in the civil rights marches and used to bring my mother to sit-ins, where she’d sit in white-only areas. That’s where I get that fight you see in me.”

3. Give back.

“I’m starting a program called Loop Dreams, which will put recording studios into high schools. Instead of watching kids drop out of school or sell drugs to get record deals, why not bring the studios to the schools? College is a choice, but high school is a necessity.”

4. Choose your friends wisely.

“The first person I call with great news is my friend Greg, who I’ve known for about 10 years. He’s the type of person who’s so honestly happy for anything that’s happening to me. Some people, if you’re happy, are like, ‘Man, what’s that doing for me?’ You need friends who have a good energy.”

5. Learn from your past.

“With every relationship, I learn something. It’s like riding a roller coaster: By the time you’re on your 10th one, you know, Okay, they come up like this and they drop right here. You learn how to plan-and when to put your hands up.”
