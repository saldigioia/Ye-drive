# A Quiet Interview With Kanye West

Last night, at the opening for George Condo’s exhibit “Mental States” at the New Museum, we’d just asked the artist — who recently painted the covers for Kanye West’s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy — if there were another musician he’d consider designing album artwork for (“Jimi Hendrix, but he’s not around anymore”), when we were suddenly joined by Kanye himself. The newly humble rapper granted us a brief but thoughtful interview.

**Are you happy with the paintings George did of you?**

[Kanye nods head yes.]

**You are happy?**

[Nods head.]

**Would you make any changes if you were to do a self-portrait?**

[Shakes head no.]

**Are you mute tonight?**

[Nods head.]

**Do you want to do sign language?**

[Nods head. Pretends to sign, then shakes our hand and walks away.]
