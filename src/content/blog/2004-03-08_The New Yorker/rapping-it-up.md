# Rapping It Up

"Slow Jamz," the song that the Chicago hip-hop producer and performer Kanye West recorded with the speed-rapper Twista and the actor Jamie Foxx, is not only one of the most popular singles of the year thus far but also has the most quoted couplet: "She's got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson / Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson." (For further study of the use of the identical rhyme in popular music, see Bob Dylan, "The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll.") With a distinctive production technique that favors samples from classic soul records (often sped up) and gospel-choir backing vocals, West has already crafted chart-topping singles for artists such as Alicia Keys, Scarface, and Jay-Z; on "The College Dropout" (Roc-a-Fella), he steps into the spotlight as a solo artist. Like many contemporary rap albums, "The College Dropout" is somewhat dropsical, with a few too many between-song skits and guest spots from fellow-rappers, but the high points are high indeed. Chief among them is "Through the Wire," which was recorded while West was recovering from a serious car wreck. Rapping through a wired-shut jaw over a sample of Chaka Khan's "Through the Fire," he reflects on both his injury and his rise through the music business with sly humor, convulsive pop-culture allusions--one verse mentions Tom Cruise, Michael Jackson (again), Mase, and the M. Night Shyamalan movie "Unbreakable"--and uncommon candor.

Twista also has a new album out, but "Kamikaze" (Atlantic), which includes a slightly different version of "Slow Jamz," is a poor cousin of "The College Dropout." Once upon a time, Twista was Tung Twista, certified by "The Guinness Book of World Records" as the fastest rapper alive. More than a decade later, he has been reupholstered for the new millennium, and while his agility and sheer velocity are still breathtaking, he is in every other regard ordinary. Only a handful of songs, including the ultraviolent "Kill Us All" and the gentle "Sunshine" (which is built on an excellent Bill Withers sample), hold their own. Fast-forward through the rest.
