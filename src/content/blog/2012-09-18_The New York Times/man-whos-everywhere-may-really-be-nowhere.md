# Man Who’s Everywhere May Really Be Nowhere

Forgive Kanye West: he’s been terribly distracted. There’s the immersion in the fashion world: “Dinner with Anna Wintour/Racing with Anja Rubik.” There’s his sneaker line with Nike: “Hold up, I ain’t trying to stunt, man/But the Yeezys jumped over the Jumpman.” There’s the still unrealized creative aspirations: “I just meditate,” he raps, “about how I could build a new Rome in one day.” And of course, there’s the new girlfriend, Kim Kardashian: “My girl a superstar all from a home movie.”

These are more than hobbies; they’re preoccupations. On “Cruel Summer” (G.O.O.D./Def Jam), the spotty new compilation from his G.O.O.D. Music label from which all of the lyrics above are drawn, Mr. West is characteristically loose, veering from rapping about depression after the death of his mother to nonsense about the former C.I.A. director George Tenet’s Maybach to making it plain exactly what’s at the forefront of his thinking lately, which is often not music.

That is, when he’s rapping at all. This being a crew album, with a lot of voices to acknowledge, Mr. West is often nowhere to be found, and more crucially, nowhere to be felt. Parts of this album — “Sin City,” “The One,” Creepers” — feature what’s easily the laziest music on any Kanye-related project, with no trace of his trademark meticulousness.

They stick out especially because through the spring and summer Mr. West has been releasing singles, all of which are on this album, that show him at or near his best. “Cold,” with its nervy synths, features some of his most sneer-filled boasts. “Mercy,” which features Big Sean, Pusha T and 2 Chainz, is a slow-and-low thumper with idiosyncratic twists: “Talking ’bout Mary, she gone off that molly/Now the whole party is melting like Dalí,” Mr. West raps. On “Clique,” he’s volatile, swerving in new directions with each couplet, and the stoical “New God Flow” feels like a return to his early years, both naïve and insistent.

Notably, the first words you hear on “Cruel Summer” aren’t from Mr. West, but rather from the besieged R&B singer R. Kelly, on “To the World,” who sings with defiant anguish, through layers of digital processing: “I’m on my Sinatra/I’m doing it my way/Let’s take it a notch up.”

Mr. West still has a complex about being underappreciated, but he’s also not one to mind the house when he’s distracted. His G.O.O.D. Music crew — Kanye’s Bad News Bears — is a mixed bag. Some of the best moments on this album belong to the snarling drug-dealer-obsessed Pusha T, Sometimes he’s there to add menace — “I think it’s good that ’Ye got a blow dealer/A hot temper matched with a cold killer” — and sometimes to toss off clever nuggets (“My Audemars like Mardi Gras”).

Big Sean stands out on “Mercy,” but unforgivably refers to himself as B.I.G. on “Clique,” lazily and gratuitously invoking the memory of the Notorious B.I.G.; 2 Chainz, so charming on his own recent album, is a nonfactor here. The crew’s most unlikely member, the smooth Nigerian pop star D’Banj, is reduced to some formless singing on “The Morning.”

Unexpectedly, two of the best moments come from outside the team, and also the era. Raekwon enlivens “The Morning,” and Ghostface Killah ignites “New God Flow”: the Wu-Tang Clan shows up the G.O.O.D. Music clan.

Operating at full intensity, Mr. West certainly wouldn’t have allowed that to happen. Why might he be so hands off?

Where Mr. West has been more present, or at least more defined, this year is on television, as a sometime guest on “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” alongside Ms. Kardashian. That he’s not an outsize presence on the show is notable: Mr. West typically eats up scenery, but next to Ms. Kardashian, he’s practically docile.

The presence of Mr. West was felt on the show before he made an appearance on camera. Ms. Kardashian’s brother Rob calls her to ask her if she heard Mr. West’s lyrics about her on “Cold”: “I’ll admit I had fell in love with Kim/Around the same time she had fell in love with him.” (That would be Kris Humphries, to whom she married, briefly, last year.)

Mr. West is often depicted as arrogant and surly, but the warm swaddle of the Kardashian clan has done him wonders. In one episode he helps clear Kim’s closet of clothes that he deems out of style and fills it up with sexier, more severe items; in another, he attends Kourtney’s baby shower and has a private moment with Khloe discussing his relationship with Kim, admitting, “It’s scary, but it’s about me being responsible with my heart.”

In all the episodes he’s smiling goofily.

To see Mr. West as a beta character is a new wrinkle in his public persona, a possible indication of rewiring still to come. That’s also evident from a streak of hometown nostalgia on “Cruel Summer” — when his future pursuits aren’t occupying his mind, his past is.

Either it’s overcompensation or an honest return to roots. There’s a striking amount of Chicago-specific moments on this album, Mr. West’s persistent reminders of where he came from on an album that mostly shows off where he’s aiming to go.

On “Cold,” the Chicago radio personality DJ Pharris shouts out various locales in the city. The Chicago spoken word poet Malik Yusef appears on “Sin City.” Mr. West laments the city’s intractable violence on “New God Flow,” and on “Don’t Like,” he remixes the breakout hit by the leader of the new, youth-driven, deeply scarred Chicago hip-hop scene, Chief Keef.

Mr. West also shouts out a slew of rappers from the city in what feels like the rare example of his trying to glom onto someone else’s credibility instead of standing on his own two feet and demanding that people assent to his terms.

But Mr. West is 35 now, and it’s difficult to keep one foot planted in the past and the other in the future. On “The One,” he raps, “Had to take it to another realm/’Cause everything around me got me underwhelmed.” Maybe he means aesthetics. Maybe he means emotions. Maybe it’s time for everyone else to fend for themselves while Mr. West finds a place to land safely.
