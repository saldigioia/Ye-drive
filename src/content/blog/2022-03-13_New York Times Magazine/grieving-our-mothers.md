# Grieving Our Mothers

## Kanye West and André 3000 Rap About Kaleidoscopic Loss

“Donda,” the album Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, released last August, is a product of grief; it’s named in honor of the artist’s mother, Donda West, a former English professor who died in 2007, and also covers the aftermath of Ye’s separation from his wife, Kim Kardashian. Three of Ye’s singles from this project — “Hurricane,” “Believe What I Say” and “Off the Grid” — are characterized by his trademark stadium thump, meant to fill arenas the size of their creator’s prodigious ego. “Life of the Party,” which didn’t appear on the original version of the album but on the extended “Donda Deluxe,” released in November, is drastically subdued. Of all the songs on the album, this one, a collaboration with André 3000, shovels closest to both rappers’ psychic turmoil.

The DNA of hip-hop songs can often be found in their samples. Ye’s single incorporates the Dramatics’ 1975 song “I Was the Life of the Party,” about a man putting on a happy face after his romance ends. “Life of the Party” concerns a more multifaceted grief — for Ye’s mom, for his marriage, for dead rappers. In addition to the Dramatics tune, the song’s title references another “Donda” track, “Jesus Lord”: “Mama, you was the life of the party/I swear you brought life to the party/When you lost your life, it took the life out the party,” Ye raps, his voice hoarse.

In “Life of the Party,” the grief is less specific and consequently feels more pervasive and overwhelming. This song finds both Ye and André 3000 in a liminal space, between versions of themselves, a kind of audio bardo. It has a minor-key mood; dark chord changes; lyrics about “spirit-spinning” events, nature and the states of discombobulation both men find themselves in. The Dramatics’ sample — “The life of the party, I laughed ’til I almost cried” — loops. Stuttering piano keys and a strolling bass line recur. The music swirls and doubles back; ad-libs by the Notorious B.I.G. ghost across the track.

André 3000 opens his verse by imagining the potential meeting, in the afterlife, of his own mother and Ye’s: “Hey Ms. Donda, you run into my mama please tell her I said, ‘Say something.’ … If there’s a heaven you would think they’d let you speak to your son.” Later Ye comes in, describing an experiential spectrum, from cradle to grave: He references an art teacher from his childhood, the near-abortion of one of his kids, Tupac’s murder. Both men come across as lost — orphaned souls in search of some explanation for all that they’ve survived.

In “Raising Kanye,” Dr. West’s 2007 memoir about parenting Ye, she writes of a moment when her son is 12 and she is panicking about getting him to the airport on time. Attempting to defuse the crisis, he asks her to stop criticizing him and contribute “only something that will help.” I was reminded of that passage toward the end of “Life of the Party,” when it poignantly samples DMX, who is assuaging his daughter’s fear as they wait for a thrill ride to start. By the end of the ride, DMX is boasting about his child’s courage. What’s left unsaid is that now DMX is gone; and so is Dr. West.

At the end of the song, Ye’s language becomes almost inchoate, like scat or the communication attempts of a child just learning to use their words. “Y’all can’t hear me … for the real me … I been. … “ And then he moans, a sound that could either evoke an orgasm or an infant’s call for aid. In that instance, when Ye doesn’t know how to express himself — or when he leaves space for the inexpressible — he achieves one of the most beautiful, humbling moments in his discography. It is a devastatingly honest counterpoint to the pompous posts he sometimes shares on social media.

In a foreword to “Raising Kanye,” Ye relays a moment from his childhood in which he sought his mother’s guidance about the variability of different forms of English: “I was saying something and asked her if it was proper. She told me it depends. Language is situational.” In “Life of the Party,” the grieving Ye, usually so loquacious, seems to be searching for words and coming up short. The opener of “Donda” features a singer chanting Dr. West’s first name for 53 seconds; in “Life of the Party,” Ye doesn’t name his mother directly (though André 3000 does). That choice further emphasizes her absence. By the time he gets to the end of this song, Ye has found himself, finally, in a situation in which there’s nothing left to say. ♦
