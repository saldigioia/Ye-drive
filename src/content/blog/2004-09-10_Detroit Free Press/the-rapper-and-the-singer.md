# The Rapper and the Singer

## Kanye West and Usher Offer Up a Dose of Reality in Their Truth Tour, Which Lands at the Palace on Saturday

Hip-hop needed a makeover. Hungover from the bling, the honeys, the rides and the other stuff most folks associate with it, hip-hop needed a new look and a new face more representative of its audience.

Enter Kanye West.

The Chicago rapper's success has put a light on the other side of hip-hop, the side that helped bring it to the forefront some 20-odd years ago. West bucked the current commercialism of hip-hop - sometimes gangsta, sometimes sexist - and favored rapping about material that he knew best: his spirituality and a raw, unfiltered opinion of his life and the lives of others like him.

West, whose oversized polo shirts, backpacks and young face make him look like just another kid on campus, brought some refreshing lyrics to his debut take "College Dropout," an album that showcased his writing, production and general all-around-good-guy appeal. In one of his first hits, "All Falls Down," West, who dropped out of a Chicago art school after one year, takes on the ideas of image and insecurity, rapping: "Man I promise, she's so self conscious / She has no idea what she's duing in college / That major that she majored in don't make no money / But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny / Now, tell me that ain't insecure / The concept of school seems so secure / Sophomore three years ain't picked a career."

"My songs are about different things that can happen in your life. It makes you feel a different way every time the music comes on," West, 27, says. "Right now, I feel like race is an interesting issue to explore more in my music. It's downplayed. But it's so relevant. What me and Dave Chappelle do is we nitpick. Racism is still alive. We point out different things. But I still have things out there that I haven't even touched. It's so much more stuff to say."

His career skyrocketed in 2001 when, after successful production stints on Mase's "Harlem World" and with the Madd Rapper, he was tapped to produce Jay-Z's much lauded "The Blueprint." On that album, West did what has made him so hot right now, reconfiguring old soul cuts with new hip-hop beats. Impressed by hearing his demo, Damon Dash, CEO of Roc-A-Fella records, signed West to the label in 2002.

"He really filled a void," says Rashaun Hall, a rap writer for Billboard Magazine. "He brought something different to the table — he talks about spirituality and professional growth and about trying to be a better person. He looks at everything from an interpersonal perspective."

That perspective, which has both embraced everyday life and lampooned it in song, has resonated with music fans everywhere. People welcomed original hip-hop back, thanking West on T-shirts and through record sales.

His first introduction to the masses was the single "Through the Wire," which told of his near-fatal car accident in October 2002. West fractured his jaw in three places. The accident became an inspiration, and West recorded the single with his jaw wired shut.

"Through the Wire" became his rap calling card and eventually was one of four singles he had on the Billboard charts — either producing or rapping or both - at the same time, an incredible feat for a newbie who was taking the music in a different direction.

Perhaps his biggest success is recording and releasing "Jesus Walks," a risk-taking single that has West praying that God shows him the way to blessedness. The song is a major coup because radios and clubs can't get enough of it, and in an effort to reach out to younger worshippers, preachers cite it in the pulpit.

The lyrics challenge anyone who listens to them:

> "So here go my single, dog, radio needs this / They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus / That means guns, sex, lies, video tapes / But if I talk about God my record won't get played, Huh? / Well let this take away from my spins/Which will probably take away from my ends / Then I hope this take away from my sins / And bring the day that I'm dreaming about / Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out / Jesus Walks / God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down/Jesus Walks / The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now."

"I was more scared not to come out with a song like that," says West, who received a leading seven Source Hip-Hop Music Awards nominations on Thursday. “I would never want to come out with songs that was saying a bunch of stuff that I didn't want to deal with; like if I was really speaking about people getting killed. I didn't want to speak about that and cause that stuff to be around. I'd rather have people that believe in God gravitate around me."

For all of hip-hop's influence, tourmate Usher says West's was a voice that was needed.

"I think he had a great intro," Usher says. "He provided a great service to Roc-A-Fella by introducing himself as a great producer and made a lot of great hits. Then he came back as a great artist. People were like 'Wow! Dude raps too? And having a strong message in his music?' “

"When I listen to his music, I listen to more than a hot beat. I think people got tired of talking about the bling-bling. The guy gave us some substance. We offer hope though our music. I'm talking about the ups-and-downs of life for me. He's talking about life. We offer opportunity with our music. And a good time."

West's early success has had him working with A-list musicians including Alicia Keys, Janet Jackson and Brandy. He's also worked with rappers Twista and Detroit's Slum Village, helping bring their largely under-the-radar music to a more mainstream forum. Even folks like soul-pop outfit Maroon 5 have sought his help.

The production credits and the collaborations have been nice, West says, helping expand his reach and put him on the map as an artist. Still, it's all a little daunting for the rapper, who is still getting used to the spotlight. After his 3-month tour with Usher ends in October, West will head back to the studio to finish his follow-up, which he says will have a different vibe than "Dropout." 

"It's like being a multimillionaire and having the opportunity to buy 12 cars all of a sudden," West says. "It feels great that there are actually people there that believed in me. I always felt like the fans would believe me. I always felt like if regular people got the opportunity to hear me they would connect with me. I knew. I am a music fan. You know how people say kids are the best judge of musie? So what if a kid actually had talent and they can use it? They would make stuff that they like and it would work because they're who you're making it for. If I really like something, then it's got to work." 

So far, nobody's complaining.
