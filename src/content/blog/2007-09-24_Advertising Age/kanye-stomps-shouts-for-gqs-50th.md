# Kanye Stomps, Shouts for GQ's 50th

GQ may have celebrated its 50th anniversary last week, but it was crotchety old Adages that was feeling the effects of time. I hope it's for financial reasons (cheap, big spaces) that businesses hold these major-league parties out in the dark bowels of western Manhattan. Surely it can't be to keep the celebrities from the gawking of the unwashed masses-considering the amount of unwashed Euro trash and celebuwannabes that cruise around these shindigs.

Of course, there were media heavyweights and celebrities to be seen. GQ Editor in Chief Jim Nelson and VP-Publisher Peter King Hunsinger. Richard Beckman, president of Conde Nast Media Group (and a former GQ publisher). Time Inc. Managing Editor Jim Kelly. Cindy Crawford. Half the cast of Saturday Night Live. And Gene Simmons from Kiss.

The big event of the evening was to be a performance by Kanye West. Kanye was introduced by GQ's Jim Nelson, who said the "music industry ought to thank God for Kanye West." (And, I assume, 50 Cent.)

The good news is that I didn't have an epileptic fit from the strobe lights and so many white people jumping up and down. In fact, after I noticed Jay-Z, Diddy, Beyonc√© and LL Cool J bouncing up and down and singing along, I figured it'd be cool if I bobbed my head knowingly. Just a little. Further, I found myself becoming the ultimate in cliches-taking video with my phone to send to my younger, cooler brother a thousand miles away.

That Kanye kid just might make it yet.
