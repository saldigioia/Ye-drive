# West Brings Big Sound to Tour

## Live Instruments Beef Up Kanye's 'Sky' Show

He has had the No. 1 song on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and performed to a sold-out crowd in Memphis last year during the Usher tour that opened FedExForum.

But hip-hop star Kanye West found out Saturday night that life as a headliner is unpredictable: He performed in front of about 2,500 at the Mid-South Coliseum, which seats 11,000 plus.

West, 28, nominated for 10 Grammys this year, bounded on stage in the glare of blinding stadium lights as he kicked off his "Touch the Sky" tour with the 2005 single of the same name.

"What's different about this tour is we've got live instruments. The full string section to go along with the deejay, keyboard player, two backup singers and a drummer, so we can freak it how we want," he shouted to the crowd.

Unfortunately, the spirited eight-piece string section was one of the few sparkles of originality, but the poster-waving fans didn't mind.

As West danced across the stage to his hit "The New Workout Plan," most audience members jumped to their feet.

When West saw a man on the front row sitting down during the hyped song, he stopped the music and yelled, "These seats are hard to get, man. I mean you can't sit down in the front row at the 'Touch the Sky Tour.'"

The show rocked on, but by the middle of the set it flat-lined on songs "Late" and "Drive Slow" from his 2005 Late Registration album.

All it took to rev things up again was the first strains of his 2004 break-out hit "All Falls Down" from his multiplatinum album, The College Dropout .

Fan Shonda Wilson broke the heel on her white stiletto grooving to the Chaka Khan sampled song "Through the Wire," an autobiographical tune about West's 2002 near-fatal car crash that left his jaw wired shut for several weeks.

"That song put me over the edge and I went down," she said about her broken heel.

Wilson said she was a huge West fan, but was disappointed that many didn't turn out for the show.

"I think it is the venue," she said. "A lot of people aren't feeling the coliseum."

The show also featured opening act, R&B newcomer Keyshia Cole, and "American Idol" winner Fantasia.

Fantasia, 21, had no problem connecting with the audience.

She transformed the large, nearly empty building into an intimate jam session.

The High Point, N.C., native bounced across the stage like a kid hyped up on Red Bull. She shimmied and strutted from one end of the stage to the other, belting out hits that included "Truth Is" and "Free Yourself."
