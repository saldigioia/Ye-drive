# Homecoming Triumphant for 'Dropout' Kanye West

There's something special happening in hip-hop. While the fractious 1990s encouraged rappers to form antagonistic alliances — East Coast and West Coast, mainstream and underground — today's hip- hop acts increasingly bristle at such arbitrary distinctions. Suddenly the worlds of mainstream acts like Jay-Z and Twista and underground sensations Common and Talib Kweli don't seem that far apart, like the overlapping circles of a Venn diagram have at last merged into one inclusive sphere.

Credit Chicago's own Kanye West as one of the key figures bringing everyone together. He's produced all the above acts as well as such singers as Alicia Keys and Janet Jackson, confidently bridging the underground with the mainstream and brilliantly blurring the line between pop, rap and R&B.

In fact, if that's all West achieved he'd be set for life, but his solo debut "The College Dropout" is one of the most creative, original and entertaining albums of the year.

Early all-ages shows are rarely the best times to catch hip-hop acts, especially when a performer is kicking off a three night/four show homecoming stand, as was West with Monday night's sold-out House of Blues show.

Still, it's always interesting to see how an artist accustomed to late nights and lax start times deals with a pre-sunset curtain call and a rigid curfew. In West's case that meant a typically excellent hour-and-a-half set, full of great "College Dropout" tracks, some fun digressions and even a taste of Ludacris, Jay-Z and Alicia Keys songs West produced.

West proved as invigorating a performer as he's inventive as a producer, bounding across the stage in his preppy white blazer as he relayed the alternately proud and proudly geeky material from "College Dropout." He rhymed about his old dead-end job in "Spaceship," then talked spiritual guidance with the dramatic "Jesus Walks." "All Falls Down" took aim at the trappings of fame, while "Slow Jamz" poked fun at R&B conventions while exploiting them at the same time.

West, who made good use of singer/pianist John Legend, also invited violin player Miri Ben-Ari to lead the hilarious "The New Workout Plan," an uptempo song that was part relationship analysis and part playful put-down session ("Oh, girl, your breath is harsh/ Cover your mouth up like you got SARS," rhymed West). He brought out Iriscience from opening act Dilated Peoples to share the mic on the latter's West produced single "This Way," then rapped about his near fatal car crash in "Through the Wire."

West finished with a part-rhymed/part spoken word chronicle of his roots, but everyone in the adoring crowd of course already knew West's back story. Given West's reception, there will be just as much respect and adulation in his future.
