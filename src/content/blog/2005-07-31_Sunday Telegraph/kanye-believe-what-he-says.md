# Kanye Believe What He Says

I’ve just got back from a holiday at the Hotel DeLusional, an exclusive resort on the California coast where stars go to become detached from reality.

J-Lo lives there, in Michael Jackson’s old suite; Madonna has her own wing; and Bono and Sting have meditation parties in the spa.

Now welcome the hotel’s most recent resident: Kanye West. Kanye has been making a laughing stock of himself lately.

At the recent Live 8 concerts he referred, both on stage and during a prior interview, to “man-made diseases placed in African communities” — an allusion to the conspiracy theory that AIDS was invented to wipe out black people. Strangely, it passed largely unnoticed.

Then, in a recent interview with NME, Kanye came up with the sort of quotes previously reserved for the likes of Mariah Carey.

Comparing his previous single, Jesus Walks, with his new one, Diamonds (which samples the James Bond theme Diamonds Are Forever), he had this to say: “It’s not to compare James Bond with Jesus, but both of them are pop icons.”

If you needed any more proof that Kanye is heading for full-time residency at Hotel DeLusional, look no further than the video for his latest single.

Officially called Diamonds (For Sierra Leone), the clip is a muddled advertisement for Kanye’s new cause: the diamond industry and the strife it’s causing in Africa.

At the end of some black-and-white shots of Kanye driving through Prague, a statement appears: “Please purchase conflict-free diamonds.”

I mean, is it really the most pressing message in the world today? And how much relevance has it to Kanye’s fans?

Do we have to remind the girls who hang out at the Westfield food court to bear in mind the political situation in west Africa next time they’re going through a sale bin at Priceline looking for bling?

The fan response to Kanye’s new cause has been divided.

Some in the chatrooms have applauded his seriousness as welcome respite from the sameness of most commercial hip-hop (Britney22 from Ontario states proudly: “My wedding ring is conflict-free!!”).

Most others it seems, are simply baffled.

Kanye’s transformation — from often brilliant pop producer and performer into semi-delusional megastar peering at the world through a gold telescope — has come a little too quickly for many.

I don’t believe a pop star has to be a top bloke. I fully support a performer’s right to be as eccentric, rude, difficult and, indeed, stark raving mad as they want to be — the only caveat being that they must have the talent to back it up.

Kanye West has talent but wouldn’t be the first star to pay the price of losing touch with the people who made him.
