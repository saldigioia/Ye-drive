# Hip-Hop Takes Center Stage

## Kanye West and Gnarls Barkley Rule Saturday at Lollapalooza

Kanye West strode onto the Lollapalooza stage, a hero to his city, and he gave that love right back.

Thick crowds filled Lollapalooza Saturday, forming long lines and jamming stages and building a rowdy reception for hometown heroes such as West, Common, and the Smoking Popes.

Organizers estimated 55,000 fans would attend each day of the three-day music fest, but crowds were much thicker on Saturday than previously as bigger names took the stage.

The second day of Lollapalooza showed how much the fest has changed since its 1990s heyday as a touring showcase of alternative hard rock bands. Hip-hop was always a component of Lollapalooza, but West's evening send-off just capped a series of strong sets that explored the myriad avenues hip-hop has taken on its road to being the biggest musical market force today.

West is not only the biggest-selling Chicago rapper in history - he's a critical and fan favorite who amounted to the biggest star of the weekend. Controversial political statements and accusations of cockiness fell by the wayside as hits like "Diamonds From Sierra Leone" and "Gold Digger" bumped throughout Grant Park. A string section accompanied the set, lending a lush opulence to West's solid, soul-based tracks that even early technical problems couldn't drain.

The video screens next to the stage allowed a great view of DJ A- -Trak’s turntable skills, something you wouldn't get to see at a club set.

Acknowledging the wealth of talent the producer/MC has worked with, West bought out red-hot local rapper Lupe Fiasco for a showcase. Another of his collaborators, introspective hometown rhymer Common, held his own as a storyteller and moralizer.

The group that fest organizer Perry Farrell introduced as his "favorite band in the world right now," Gnarls Barkley, drew a large afternoon crowd, emerging to the strains of Queen's "We Are the Champions." The duo of vocalist Cee-Lo and DJ Danger Mouse scored this year's most unlikely hit with the cool soul number "Crazy," but with a full band, back-up singers, and a string section (everyone clad like tennis players), it was clear their little collaboration hit the big time.

The Gnarls debut, "St. Elsewhere," is a loose concept album about insanity, so those who only knew the single were surprised by a series of moody jams and quirky dance tracks.

Bay Area MC Lyrics Born led a band steeped in dirty funk, spitting intricate rhymes with a breathless flow while encouraging the audience to stop complaining and embrace love. His own object of affection, Joyo Velarde, played the sultry diva, letting loose her impressive pipes at the side of the gravel-voiced LB.

Peeping Tom, the new solo project of vocal gymnast Mike Patton (Faith No More, Mr. Bungle, Fantomas), pumped out soulful hip-hop-based pop with a supporting cast that included DJ Mike Relm and rapper/human beatbox Rahzel of The Roots. Patton, clad in a dapper white suit he soon soaked through, moved from a seductive croak to a soaring croon, proving that even such an obstinately weird singer can deliver catchy tunes.

The Flaming Lips won the crowd over with trademark goofy stunts like groups of dancing aliens and Santa Clauses and lead singer Wayne Coyne crowd-surfing in a giant, clear plastic beach ball.

With his thin, high-pitched voice like a little boy channeling an old woman, Coyne's enthusiasm led the crowd into a series of sing-alongs, culminating with the joyous "Do You Realize."

In one of the few political statements of the fest, he called for the crowd's energy to stop traffic on Lake Shore Drive and stop Israel's bombing of Lebanon.

Lollapalooza veterans Sonic Youth, carrying venerated status as critical darlings, couldn't overcome the painfully hoarse and flat vocals by Kim Gordon. They worked much better applying their signature orchestrated guitar noise to instrumentals.

Crystal Lake's own Smoking Popes were a welcome tonic to a parade of long jams. Their tight, punchy pop tunes rang out on crunchy guitars and Josh Caterer's exuberant crooning on crowd favorites like "I Need You Around" and catchy forthcoming singles like "If You Don't Care."
