# Ready to Wed! 

Kim Kardashian had achieved the near impossible. Since daughter North's early arrival June 15, the camera-loving reality star managed to stay hidden from the public eye. But once she was ready to end her 49-day self-imposed exile, she did it in true Kardashian fashion: on television. Kim shocked her mother, Kris Jenner, on Jenner's August 2 talk show by appearing in a brief video message. Congratulating the Kris host on her latest venture, the new mom apologized not appearing in person. "I'm just loving life a little bit too much at home right now," she ex- plained. digital visit was enough for a tearful Jenner, who exclaimed, "That was a great surprise!"

It's not the only trick Kim has up her silk Lanvin sleeve. Insiders say she and boyfriend Kanye West have secretly been making wedding plans. "They've been discussing marriage for a while," says a source close to the Grammy winner, 36. "A wedding is in the works." The twice-divorced reality mogul, 32, has told friends she wants an understated affair after her $10 million two-part

E! wedding spectacular to Boston Celtics forward Kris Humphries resulted in a 72-day union. But that may not cut it for the theatrical rapper, who promoted his most recent album, Yeezus, by projecting ing images of his face onto 66 buildings around the world. "Kanye has never been married before and wants a big wedding," explains a close Kim confidant. "So Kim is getting used to the idea again!" It's a small concession considering how much West has changed his behavior following the birth of their daughter. Though the Chicago-bred star spent much of Kim's pregnancy in his Paris recording studio more than 5,000 miles away, he has barely left the house since meeting their child. "The baby has solidified their relationship," says a Kim source. "They're doing really well."

## Lavish Plans

Just last fall, the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star gushed to U.K.'s Tatler that her ideal nuptials would be "on an island with just my friends and family, and that's it." Indeed, an insider says her preferred guest list would be just "30 to 50 people - not even extended family."

But West wants all of his nearest and dearest to witness him saying "I do." Says a pal, "He wants something really cool and big and over-the-top." No matter how long the guest list, though, it won't include an E! camera crew. After successfully persuading the press-courting Kardashian crew to keep photos of their newest addition under wraps, he's extending his privacy mandate to the wedding. Says a source, "It will not be televised."

Nor will it be anywhere near Hollywood. "They'll most likely have a destination wedding," says the source, adding that they're considering sites near West's 19th-century Parisian pad. "It's a city that's very close to Kanye's heart," says the source. And the groom will have his say on more than just the locale. A West source says the self-described Louis Vuitton don will tap some of his designer pals to play a role in the nuptials. "It won't be cheesy," says a West insider. "There will be a real sense of design."

West's skills will come in handy when it comes to creating Kim's sparkler. Though Kim ultimately chose her $1.8 million 20-plus-carat Lorraine Schwartz diamond from Humphries, "that won't be the case with Kanye," says a source of the A.P.C. collaborator. "Kanye is very interested in design and decor. He will want to be involved in all of that." But the most crucial detail for West, says a source, is simply making Kim his bride: "He wants to get married more than she does!"

## A Changed Man

It's all part of Kanye 2.0. Since North's arrival, the "I Am a God" artist has transformed from self-involved superstar to devoted family man. "He has matured and grown a lot very quickly," says a Kim source. Even West's friends have noticed a change. "He seems a lot more at peace," says the West source. "It's cool to see him so happy and calmed down. He's a natural father." He has brushed up on his boyfriend skills as well. During Kim's turbulent pregnancy, she wasn't sure West was up for the job. "She felt like he was incredibly distant and she was very worried about the relationship," says a source. But after meeting his daughter, West put his baby over his business - canceling all scheduled appearances just as Yeezus was hitting the shelves. "He did it on his own accord. Kim didn't ask him to," says the source. "Now Kim is very confident about their love."

West has also proven himself to another key Kardashian. Though insiders feared having West and family matriarch Jenner under the same roof was a recipe for disaster (this is the same man who chided Jenner for complimenting his music with a simple "great job"), bunking in Jenner's six-bedroom Hidden Hills pad has led to more heart-to-hearts than heated exchanges. A Kim source says the duo stay up late swapping stories while the exhausted new mom sleeps. "That's their time to really get to know each other." For West, the nighttime story sessions help fill the void he has felt since losing mom Donda suddenly in 2007. Says the West insider, "He feels like he has a family again."

Now his would-be mother-in-law is eager to make the West-Kardashian merger official. Jenner has joked she's "annoyed" that the wedding has yet to happen. "I think they all think they're Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn now," she said on The Talk July 18, also lamenting eldest daughter Kourtney's decision not to marry longtime boyfriend Scott Disick. "I've tried to just take a backseat, keep my mouth shut and learn that this is the way they're doing this." She won't have to bite her tongue much longer. "They're so happy and crazy for each other," says one insider of the duo of 16 months. "I see them getting married soon."

## The Weight Wait

Or as soon as Kim can slip into her size 2 dream gown. After enduring cruel comments from fat-shamers during her pregnancy, the 5-foot-2 star isn't about to walk down the aisle until she has reclaimed her pre-baby body. One friend says the star wants to lose her 50 pregnancy pounds and then some. Explains the source, "Kim doesn't want to get married until her body is sick."

But as Kim commits to twice-daily workouts and a healthy diet, that time is fast approaching. Insiders say the star, who plans to breast-feed for six months, has shed more than 25 pounds in seven weeks. "Shell be hot any day now," pal Jonathan Cheban predicts to Us. "A girl like that can't be held down!"

That leaves just one obstacle on the pair's path to "I do": West's planned fall tour to promote his album. "He has a lot to do to launch it," says a West source, who adds it may kick off in October. Says the close Kim confidant, "They won't get married before then." But with Kim and baby North tagging along - "They're going to make it a really fun family thing," says the West pal - the trip could be the perfect time to finalize plans for the big day. Says the West insider, "He just wants to do it right."

After all, in the musician's mind, this wedding has been in the works for years. "He has told his friends and family that he was going to wife her since the day they met," says a West pal. "And he is determined to do it."
