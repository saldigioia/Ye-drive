# Self-Indulgent but Dark and Delicious

The promotional rollout of Kanye West’s fifth album has been, in itself, a work of art.

After his post-Taylor Swift-incident comeback at the MTV Video Music Awards, awkward reconciliation with George W. Bush, 35-minute film, outrageous Twitter presence, and - why not? - leaked nude photo, it would have been the musical anticlimax of the year had My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy not lived up to the hype.

But West has consistently demonstrated a talent that justifies his obscene arrogance and, predictably, his latest work is nothing short of phenomenal. In 13 songs, the rapper-producer brings to terms hip-hop purism, pop-radio gloss and high-culture sophistication without sacrificing the vulnerability that makes him such a compelling figure.

The album opens with the thunderous “Dark Fantasy,” where West delivers lyrics both profound (“The plan was to drink until the pain over, but what’s worse, the pain or the hangover?”) and absurd (“Sex is on fire, I’m the King of Leon-a Lewis”) before the track’s piano-laden beat gives way to a plaintive voice singing, “Can we get much higher?”

Equally symphonic is “All of the Lights,” with stately horns, marching band drums and 11 featured guests framing West’s dramatic story of a troubled relationship under the glare of fame.

A defensive Jay-Z reaches new levels of haughtiness on “So Appalled” while Nicki Minaj steals the posse cut “Monster” with her ferocious verse. “Lost in the World” converts Bon Iver’s a cappella number “Woods” into a kinetic anthem about excess and redemption, themes that unify the whole record.

Twisted Fantasy is self-indulgent at times, which isn’t surprising for an artist who spent most of his last project blubbering in Auto-Tune. “Runaway” could have been about four minutes lighter, and the Gil Scott-Heron-sampling “Who Will Survive in America” is a gratuitous outro. That said, if any album can get away with a few decorative flourishes, it’s this one.
