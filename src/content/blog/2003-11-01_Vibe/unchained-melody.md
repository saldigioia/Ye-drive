# Unchained Melody

Roc-A-Fella’s latest MC, Kanye West, is an only child. R And seeing him do the running man, musicless, with almost no prompting, makes one curious about the A-list beatmaker’s motivations for recording a solo rap album. On a break from fine-tuning a track with fellow Chicagoan Carl Thomas, West tips his hand. “I want all the attention,” he admits. “If I can make other people hits, why not make myself hits?”

As a producer, he’s crafted big radio records, most notably providing the backdrop for Jay-Z’s soul-drenched The Blueprint. But not only does West, 26, twist knobs magnificently, he has something to say outside the double- time speed of a soul sample. His outstanding solo debut, The College Dropout, combines sinuous beats and sharp, insightful wordplay. And when he gives a guided tour of the album, West plays each track, and if he thinks you haven’t heard every word clearly, he will play it again. “I don’t make songs, I make movies,” he says. “So I don’t want you to miss a part.”

As a young MC and producer, he was mentored by underground luminary No I.D.- their mothers were friends. West’s mom is an academic who formerly chaired the English department at Chicago State University, while his dad is a Black Panther turned Christian marriage counselor.

An aspiring rhyme sayer, West signed with Damon Dash in 2002 after dropping a few verses his way. West holds up his standard issue Roc-A-Fella diamond pendant and says, “This chain is hiding my insecurities. I come from a culture where there’s no money, and when you get money, you put all of your self-worth in a chain.”

But instead of fighting his insecurities, West emphasizes the contradictions in his character. “A lot of the things I talk about is like smoking cigarettes-things you know you’re bad about,” he says. “But I rap about it negatively rather than try to justify it the way people justify selling drugs. My claim to fame is to be honest.” He caresses the pendant. “And some days I even feel comfortable enough to walk out without the chain on.” Looks like his future is secure.
