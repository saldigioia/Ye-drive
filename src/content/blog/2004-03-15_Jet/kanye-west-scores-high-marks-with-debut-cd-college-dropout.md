# Kanye West Scores High Marks With Debut CD 'College Dropout'

Whether it’s hip hop or R&B, Kanye West is respected as the man to go to for a soulful beat that’s sure to land at the top of the charts. Now the superproducer makes his way to the head of the class as he steps from behind the soundboard and in front of the mic to deliver his debut CD College Dropout.

West, the trackmaster behind Jay-Z’s Izzo (H.O.V.A.), Ludacris’ Stand Up, and Alicia Keys’ You Don’t Know My Name, is not known for his rapping abilities, but he is known for making great music and College Dropout is no exception. His highly anticipated CD made its way to the top of the charts, selling an impressive 450,000 copies its first week in stores.

Just a few months after he signed as an artist with Roc-A-Fella Records, the 26-year-old, who says he represents the “regular guy,” almost lost his life and the career that he strived so hard to achieve.

After a late-night recording session in Los Angeles in October of 2002, West, sustained injuries from a near fatal car accident that left his jaw fractured in three places.

“I have flashbacks of what happened every day,” confesses West. “Anytime I hear about any accident, my heart sinks in and I just thank God that I’m still here.”

Instead of moping about his injuries, the Chicago native used the accident as musical inspiration. With his mouth wired shut just weeks after the car crash, he recorded the lead single Through The Wire, which tells a personal and witty account of the accident. West rhymes, “So I turned tragedy to triumph/Make music that’s fire/Spit my soul through the wires.”

Soon after the first release, West was back in heavy radio rotation with the hit Slow Jamz that features Chicago rapper Twista and comedian/singer Jamie Foxx, which gives him credit for two of the hottest songs in the country.

College Dropout delivers lyrics by West that are clever, inspirational, quirky and insightful.

On the song Jesus Walks West talks about the importance of having Jesus in his life. An act that some, including West himself, would consider rather risky. “Well if this take away from my spins/Which will probably take away from my ends/Then I hope it take away from my sins,” he raps on the song.

Despite the fact that West dropped out of college (hence the name College Dropout), he strongly believes that a person should set his own goals in life and not let anyone dictate what he needs to do to become successful.

The 16-track CD also features cameo appearances by several of the hit-makers West has worked with in the past, including Jay-Z, Talib Kweli, Mos Def, Ludacris and Common.

West says that his love for rapping began in his early teens. He started producing music just so that he could have something to rap over. West was later tutored in production by Chicago producer NO I.D., who helped him to sharpen his skills.

West’s big break came when he attracted the attention of Roc-A-Fella Records decision-makers Damon Dash and Jay-Z. He then went on to fully showcase his talents on Jay-Z’s CD The Blueprint.

Since then West has been on a mission to take music to the next level with his signature style that reconfigures vintage R&B samples with today’s beats.

“I feel like a lot of the soul that’s in those old records that I sample is in me,” explains West. “So when I hear them I put them with the drums and I bring them to the new millennium. It’s just like God’s doing that.

“And you’d best believe, I saved some monsters for my album.”
