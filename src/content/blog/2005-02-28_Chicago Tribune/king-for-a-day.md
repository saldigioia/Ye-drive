# King for a Day 

When the spotlight wasn’t shining on Kanye West, who attended his own tribute concert Sunday at the House of Blues, he almost passed for just another hip-hop fan enjoying a good show.

Seated in the second-floor balcony and dressed in one of his signature preppy sweaters, the Grammy-winning rapper who had come to celebrate the proclamation of “Kanye West Day” in Chicago looked like all the other people singing along and dancing with friends.

It was hardly the picture of a megastar who drew such a huge crowd that it caused a near-riot only an hour earlier, when hundreds of fans who had waited hours to gain admission to the concert were turned away at the door by dozens of police officers.

Police were called to clear out the crowd a little after 6:30 p.m. at the concert site, 329 N. Dearborn St., police spokesman Carlos Herrera said, adding that they quickly got rid of the crowd with few problems.

Some fans, including 18-year-old Shaundra Pratt of Chicago who waited hours to get into the free concert, said the officers were too rough, claiming that Mace was sprayed over the crowd.

Herrera did not know if Mace was used.

When the chaos among frustrated fans died down outside, though, an air of celebration picked up inside as fans celebrated their star in the packed venue.

Between the screaming fans, speeches by his former high school teachers, local hip-hop artists performing his songs and a speech from his mother gushing with pride — Kanye was The Man.

If it wasn’t enough for Chicago to proclaim Kanye’s arrival into superstardom, then P. Diddy solidified it.

“Martin Luther King has a day,” the music mogul said in a prerecorded video. “The presidents have a day. Jesus has a day. Now Kanye West has a day.”

Diddy — along with everyone from Bulls stars Kirk Hinrich, Eddy Curry and Tyson Chandler, to Usher and Mayor Daley — welcomed Kanye to “the Key club,” which Diddy said was for people who have the key to their cities.

The mayor’s spokeswoman, Jacquelyn Heard, presented Kanye with his proclamation after several local artists such as White Boy performed songs from “The College Dropout.” WGCI-FM 107.5 radio, which organized the event, also presented him with a framed photo of the Chicago skyline.

“For someone who loves to stunt about how many records he’s sold and how much money he’s made, I can’t believe you guys gave me this to stunt about,” Kanye said when he was given the proclamation. “You gave me my own day. Lately, I’ve had to defend myself for being confident all the time, but when something like this happens, you should be able to talk just a little bit.”

He went on to thank Chicago for supporting him, saying he has felt nothing but love from the city since he made it big.

“I know what it’s like on the West Side, South Side, East Side,” he said. “I know it’s hard to make it through school, through work, through winter, through life. Three years ago I was standing outside the House of Blues begging to get in, and now I’ve got Grammys and Mayor Daley giving me the key to the city.

“But I know I have to bring it back to where it all started.”

Fans who attended the concert were thrilled to see their role model recognized by his hometown.

“It’s fitting because he has made such an impact on everybody,” said Melanie Brezill, an 18-year-old Northwestern University student who also sang the a cappella background to “Jesus Walks” in the concert’s finale. “He’s a regular person from the South Side like me. He gives people who want to be leaders an example.”
