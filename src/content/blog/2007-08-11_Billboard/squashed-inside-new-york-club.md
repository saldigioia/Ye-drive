# Squashed Inside New York Club

## S.O.B.’s, Fans Are Reliving the 1992 Cult Hip-Hop Flick “Juice.” the Film Centers Around a DJ Named Q, Who Uses a DJ Competition as an Alibi to Rob the Neighborhood Bodega.

Tonight, three sets of turntables, three mics and numerous established DJs fill the small space, with Kanye West, Just Blaze and Swizz Beatz sitting in to judge a winner. West, decked out in a multicolored hoodie, a neon-green shirt and a chunky plastic yellow watch, is especially poker-faced as he surveys the contestants.

But after the winner, Jack the Ripper, is announced, an impromptu all-star concert breaks out, with a smiling West joining Mos Def, Tatib Kweli, Common, Q-Tip and Queen Latifah on the tiny stage. And before the crowd trails out, sweaty and happy, Channel Live rapper Hakim announces, to screaming agreement: “The biggest thing that happened in hip-hop in the last 10 years was when Kanye put George Bush in his motherfuckin’ place.”

Tonight’s fans aren’t the only ones who appreciate the kind of candor West demonstrated when he made his comments during a live Hurricane Katrina telethon in 2005.

West takes big risks, and those risks have generally paid off. Indeed, he has made himself an eminently marketable commodity in music by going against the conventional wisdom of how a star should behave: calling out world leaders on national TV, complaining about his lack of respect or collaborating with decidedly un-hip-hop names like John Mayer and producer Jon Brion.

The first official single from his third Def Jam album, “Graduation,” due Sept. 11, is case in point. While contemporary urban music has lately dabbled in electronic sounds, West has taken it a step further by choosing to introduce his latest project with the synth-heavy single “Stronger” which samples Daft Punk’s “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger” and slows downs the beat. The track is the top debut On The Billboard Hot 100 week No. 47. “That melody just hit me so hard,” West says when asked for the song inspiration. “I mean, it’s the music. It wasn’t a gimmick thing.”

“That’s not atypical of Kanye,” Def Jam president and West mentor Jay-Z says, “It’s been ms pattern since day one, He always has to push the envelope, That’s his cross to bear.

The argument could be made that West’s genuine artistry, knack for hit songs and penchant for unpredictability make him one of hip-hop’s last rock stars, So it’s precisely West’s singular place in hip-hop that will make or break “Graduation.”

“Kanye has an edge, and when he steps up and says something meaty [like his Bush remarks], he’s doing it out of passion.” Def Jam senior VP of marketing Tracey Waples says, “That’s what’s made him the people’s champ. It’s the common man’s perspective,”

But what is the cost of being a headstrong artist who’s usually ahead of the curve? So far. West has not fallen out of favor on Madison Avenue. as evidenced by past branding partnerships with Pepsi and Boost Mobile. Brand Keys founder/president Robert Passikoff calls the artist’s outspoken personality “refreshing. While there’s risk involved [in working with such an artist], it’s also the kind of thing advertisers who are desperate for some sort of engagement are willing to risk.”

And West is aware of times he’s stepped over the line. Island Def Jam chairman Antonio “L.A.” Reid “talking me out of doing the ‘Gold Digger’ video and making it, all slaves,” he says by way of example. “Saying, ‘We don’t need to do this. You’re crazy.” Sometimes as a creative person, you go off the deep end a Little. The downside is, you don’t always know when to stop.”

### Road to Riches

West endured a well-documented rocky path from Chicago obscurity to Roc-a-Fella Records hitmaker. Born in Atlanta, he moved to the Windy City with his English professor mother Donda, After high school at the American Academy of Art, he enrolled at Chicago State University. He eventually dropped out to produce music full time, but he always viewed his time behind the boards as a means to an end.

“I was inspired by the Doors movie,” West says. “I saw Jim Morrison and said, ‘It want to be just like that.’”

After linking with Midwest producer No ID, West soaked up all he could and practiced religiously. A meeting with Roc-a-Fella A&R man Kyambo “Hip-Hop” Joshua resulted in his beats being utilized by such label acts as Jay-Z and Beanie Sigel, and West moved to a New Jersey apartment to further his dreams.

“He’ll play his songs for any and everybody that’s willing to listen,” longtime friend and producer 88-Keys says. “But his true friends are who he really listens to just because they’re most likely to tell the truth like ‘Aw. man. Take out that high-hat.’ He’s very open to criticism.” Following the success of such West-crafted hits as “H to the Izzo” and “Bonnie & Clyde,” Roc-a-Fella partners Jay-Z and Damon Dash saw past initial fears that he was not street enough to market as a rapper.

They gave him the green light to make his debut album, 2004’s “The College Dropout.”

“He stretches boundaries,” Jay-Z says. “Who knew guys in the hood would bump OutKast’s ‘Hey Ya!?”

At a time when the street-hustling lyrics or 50 Cent, T.I. and Jadakiss were pervasive, West was touting himself with a teddy bear as a mascot and railing against higher education. “Dropout” has sold 3 million copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan, and spawned the singles “Through the Wire” (literally recorded while his mouth was clamped shut after a car accident), “All Falls Down” and “Jesus Walks.”

Other artists recognized West as a unique talent capable of transcending genre boundaries. “I was sitting in Sting’s dressing room at Live 8,” Waples recalls. “And Sting, Bono, John Mayer and Kanye were making up a song. In that moment I understood why he was able to be there. 50 or T.I. would never be able to be in that room.”

In 2006, West defied the sophomore slump with “Late Registration,” which shifted 860,000 units in its debut week. First single “Diamonds From Sierra Leone” highlighted the industry’s violent practices and even inspired Russell Simmons to go on a fact-finding trip to South Africa. The mood was much more party-friendly on the follow-up, “Gold Digger,” which sampled Jamie Foxx covering Ray Charles and spent 10 weeks at No. 1 on The Billboard Hot 100. “That was just like, to me, my most perfectly written song to date,” West enthuses of the latter cut.

On “Graduation,” only Coldplay’s Chris Martin, T-Pain, Mos Def and a solitary track from DJ Toomp made the cut as guest contributors, because, as West says in a New York hotel the day after the S.O.B.’s bash, “when I hear the records of my favorite bands—the Killers or Coldplay—you only hear one voice from start to finish.”

The album’s initial street single, the Toomp-produced “Can’t Tell Me Nothing,” was intended for Young Jeezy, but he wasn’t sure enough about it to record it himself. Two videos for the song are already out: A more traditional Hype Williams-directed clip in which West appears was made available for free download via iTunes, and a bizarre interpretation by comedian Zach Galifianakis and indie rock veteran Will Oldham, shot on Galifianakis’ North Carolina farm, turned up on West’s Web site.

Elsewhere, “Drunk & Hot Girls” finds West complaining that he’s worked too hard to waste time chasing gifts that might throw up in his car, while “Good Life” featuring T-Pain is a bombastic cut utilizing a screwed sample of Michael Jackson’s “P.Y.T.” A video has been shot for the latter song, which West says has “everything you don’t like—girls, cars and champagne. Lots of it.”

West proudly cops to being influenced by such left-field al burns as Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke’s 2006 solo effort “The Eraser” while crafting the music for “Graduation.” And though he may feel liberated from hip-hop’s sonic constraints, one has to wonder if his new sound is going to translate with the Brooklyn bodega regulars.

“You can’t control if people are going to buy your music. At the end of the day you have to keep challenging yourself,” Jay-Z says. “He has zero problem with that. He is never complacent. We mixed ‘Stronger,’ I’m not even joking with you, 17 times. He could not get the bass drum exactly the way he wanted it.”

“The beauty of Kanye is his unpredictability,” Reid adds. “You don’t get to the cover of Time magazine by being fluffy. Real stars are on their path and they don’t apologize. Jimi Hendrix threw his guitar down and set it on fire. He didn’t think about ‘Should I?’ He just set his guitar on fire. The ones thinking about it too hard aren’t real stars. That’s manufactured.”

### Capitalizing on Kanye

With “Graduation” nearing release, West and his team are ramping up the marketing plan. Manager G Roberson says a multiplatform branding deal is in the works with Louis Vuitton but declined to reveal details. He is fielding offers from several beverage companies, including Pepsi, with which West previously ran a TV campaign in 2005.

A Coke partnership is also taking shape, which West says “is going to be more of a design thing than celebrity.”

“With an artist like Kanye, who’s that involved in his marketing, you don’t do one-off deals,” Roberson says. “If we’re in bed with you, then it’s going to be a multiplatform deal.”

West’s creativity will have another chance to shine on the fall Glow in the Dark tour, on which he is collaborating with Madonna choreographer Jamie King. Dates have yet to be announced. Contrary to the poor touring track record for major hip-hop stars, West has been a consistent box-office draw: His 2005 tour with Fantasia and Keyshia Cole grossed $8.4 million and drew more than 210,000 people to 46 shows reported to Billboard Boxscore.

“A lot of people want to be too cool onstage,” West says when asked why hip-hop tours don’t sell tickets. “I do an hour-and-a-half with no hype man, running around onstage. The touring can only get better because the longer a song’s out, the more people get into it.”

In line with his exotic cultural tastes, West asked Japanese pop artist Takashi Murakami to design the “Graduation” album packaging. One possible cover, which West pulls up on his laptop, boasts an illustrated globe horizontally split in half against a teal background. His bear mascot is seen bouncing off the top, with a graduation hat and scroll following suit.

“He’s doing all of the merchandising,” West says. “We have animated commercials and a whole piece to one of the songs. It won’t be finished until October. Murakami’s going to unveil that at his Los Angeles MOMA exhibit, and I’ll perform.”

On top of everything else, West is launching a clothing line, Pastelle, later this year through popular Japanese street-wear line Bathing Ape, whom he says he “begged” to team up with him.

Back at the hotel, West, who is still wearing the same hoodie and jeans he had on at S.O.B.’s, quietly sets down his Louis Vuitton luggage. Last night’s festivities have both drained and birthed new inspiration. Making a whispered phone call to Brion, West the producer’s voice mail to black out nine days to finish “Graduation.”

If West is feeling pressure, though, it is his own. As his natural artistic progression has catapulted him to rock star status, his bosses, according to Jay-Z, “pretty much stay out of his way.”

“I want everything associated with me to be the best and push the boundary of what you think is possible,” West says as he leaves the Four Seasons for a session at Legacy Studios. “Whether it’s my music, my videos or my tour, I’m trying to be the best.”

### What’s Really G.O.O.D.?

#### West Confronts Struggles as Label Head

Kanye West has conquered adversity in his personal and professional life, but even he wasn’t prepared for the ups and downs of running his own label. The artist’s G.O.O.D. Music, distributed by Columbia for its first two years, was dropped by the major amid layoffs earlier this year. This despite the success of John Legend’s two releases under the partnership, which have shifted more than 3 million copies combined.

Now, artists GLC, Really Doe, Sa-Ra and Fonzworth Bentley are without label homes.

Consequence, who remains on Sony, previously complained that G.O.O.D. president John Monopoly was not supportive of his project, asserting that West had to step in and pick up the pieces. Monopoly denied the allegations.

G.O.O.D. was also involved in the release of the last two Common albums, 2005’s “Be” and the new “Finding Forever,” but the rapper is signed directly to Geffen.

“Running a record label was the biggest mistake I ever made,” West says. “I never asked to be a label owner. Sony offered it to me, and I took it. But I can’t be there when people are calling me to the studio to hear some music or approve clothes for a video. No disrespect to anybody—my focus is ‘Graduation.’ I’ve got a hard enough time calling radio programmers and getting them to play ‘Can’t Tell Me Nothing,’ a song that’s connecting with people but that’s only at 1,400 spins.”

West manager G. Roberson is waiting to reshop the label until after the release of “Finding Forever” and “Graduation.” Wherever it winds up, West will no longer be the figurehead while someone else runs the day-to-day.

“Yeah, it sounds good on paper,” West says. “I still love the concept of just getting into the studio with John Legend or Common and making music. I always use Rick Rubin before he joined Sony as my example, he worked with whomever he choose.”

West is also in preproduction for an HBO sitcom inspired by his life. “We’re still working on the pilot,” West says. “We have to deliver a product that will connect with pop culture and make an impact.”
