# Arrogant? Not Me. I Just Knew I Was Going to Win 

## He Doesn't Wear Sports Gear; He Doesn't Talk About Guns. But Kanye West Is the Hip- Hop Sensation of the Year. He Talks to Chris Campion

Ohio State University is marching to the beat of a college dropout. Not just any college dropout, mind, but rapper and producer Kanye (pronounced Kan-yay) West. He frantically paces the stage, reciting the lyrics to his song Jesus Walks as if his life depended on it. Currently residing in the UK top 20, the track is not your standard rap material: the song details his battle to balance the temptations and demands of his secular lifestyle with his spiritual beliefs.

This being the American Mid-West, these things strike a chord. The all-ages crowd, racially mixed but largely female, are on their feet, stamping, waving and singing every word. West, 26, has turned the atmosphere in the Schottenstein Center sports arena into something resembling a revival meeting, an impression heightened by the fact that he's wearing a white suit. The pendant around his neck - a $25,000 piece in the shape of Jesus's head, with a diamond crown of thorns - glints in the light.

West's debut album, College Dropout, has sold more than three million copies worldwide since its release in February. Its success has turned him into the de facto leader of the new school in hip- hop, a redeemer who has injected a dose of honesty and light- heartedness into a genre that seems otherwise content to peddle its gun-toting urban fantasies for as long as the money keeps rolling in. West's approach has seen him nominated for an unprecedented seven MOBOs in the UK awards to be announced at the end of this month.

"I'm not really a rapper with a conscience," he says. "I'm just a regular person, even though I have a good job. And regular people have a conscience. Their lives are so much more interesting than performers'." As West talks backstage after the show, he is simultaneously tapping away on a computer game and keeping one eye on a man sitting next to him, who's mocking up a logo for West's new record label Very Good Music on a laptop. Even without the suit, the way West dresses is very

un-hip-hop, tending toward the preppy look of khaki slacks and collegiate sweaters.

"What's a performer's life?" he continues. "I went and bought a Benz today! But the things that regular people go through - love, pain, work, dreams - that's real."

The joy of College Dropout is that does not inhabit the largely fabricated milieu of ghetto hardship that defines most commercial rap. The "struggle" West describes is as much internal as external, as if he is engaged in a dialogue with himself, growing into an understanding of the ways of the world through experience. Spaceship talks about working by day as a token black employee at Gap, and crafting beats by night that can take him away from it all.

As often as not he uses humour to get his message across. The New Workout Plan is a deft parody of aerobics exercise tapes that mocks the lengths young black women will go to snag a successful man. Musically, the album is a modern take on classic 1960s soul and gospel with, in equal measure, enough bounce to move the dancefloor and melody to entice the mainstream - a sound that has become West's hallmark as a producer.

Outside of work, West favours listening to rock over hip-hop, and recently admitted a fondness for Mercury Prize winners Franz Ferdinand. "But my all-time favourite group is Red Hot Chilli Peppers," he says, before bursting into a few bars of By The Way. Much of the backstage banter between West and his tour DJ A-Trak, a prodigious Jewish-Canadian from Montreal with a seemingly encyclopaedic knowledge of hip-hop, centres around music trivia.

Conversation turns to West's seven MOBO nominations, the most for one artist in the history of the awards. The news doesn't seem to have surprised West. "If I ever said some asinine shit like, `Yo, I'm gonna get nominated for the most awards ever,' people would just say I'm arrogant? But I'm not," he says. "So many people I work with just don't believe." He stops tapping on the console, looks up and focuses. "I don't see what's wrong with saying, I'm going to sell three million records. Not even saying `I want to' but `I am going to', in order to give myself that confidence. But people turn around and say I'm arrogant."

He pauses, cocks his head and resumes, gradually working himself into a frenzy.

"They're doubting. They're saying, first of all, you can't do it. And secondly, your method - to build your esteem up so that you have something to believe in and set your goals - is wrong too.

So they bashing you on both ends. You can't believe that there is something greater for you out there. [He puts on whingey voice] `Oh, he's so arrogant! He has dreams. Why should he dream? And if he does dream, don't let him say it loud!'"

What his detractors perceive as conceit comes across more as intense self-belief, confidence and drive, a by-product of his candid admission (on his previous top 10 hit, All Fall Down) that he's "so self-conscious".

Perhaps West is just a typical only child. His parents separated when he was three and he lived mostly with his mother, an English Literature professor at Chicago State University, spending holidays with his photo-journalist father in Atlanta. Aged 10, he spent a year in China, when his mother took up a teaching position in Nanjing.

"I think that got me ready to be a celeb because, at that time, a lot of Chinese had never seen a black person. They would come up and stare at me, rub my skin, fishbowl me."

Undaunted, he took advantage of his

otherness by breakdancing on the streets for spare change. "Oh, how did you know that?" he says, genuinely surprised when asked about the story. "Scotland Yard would love to get their hands on that piece of evidence." He pauses. "Where that come from?" he asks, playfully, looking around to see if anyone can identify his quotation. "Austin Powers," he declares triumphantly when everyone is stumped. This happens often. When the conversation in the room drops, or whenever West gets bored with a line of questioning, he seems compelled to fill the void by spouting lines of movie dialogue, the origin of which always seems to confound his associates.

"My grandfather, my father and my mother were all activists," he continues. "My grandfather was the original hustler. He shined shoes and did whatever he had to do to send all his kids to college." In the '70s, his father briefly became involved with the Black Panther Party, speaking at rallies. "He was a military brat who grew up in Germany as a black kid among white folks. So he was looking for a place to fit in, to be a part of a movement, a struggle. And they accepted him."

West went through a similar struggle to find acceptance himself, striving for years to become accepted as a rapper. "No one really wanted to produce when I was young. I was trying to rap. And I made beats because what else was I going to rap on - other people's beats?"

At the same time, he pursued an academic career, attending first art college and then Chicago State University as an English major, at the same time as his mother headed up the English department. "Most of the time I'd be in music class or in the lunch room talking to girls," he shrugs. When he decided to drop out after a year and a half of study, he already had a production deal on the table from Columbia Records. He got his first breaks as a producer through the patronage of Jay-Z, who used several of West's tracks for his 2001 album The Blueprint.

West eventually signed with Jay-Z's label

Roc-a-fella as an artist in his own right. But in October 2002, before he was even able to drop a note, he had a head-on collision in his car after leaving the studio late one night. His jaw was fractured in three places.

He turned the accident, which could have derailed his rap career, into his calling card, leaving his hospital bed to lay down his first single, Through the Wire, literally through gritted teeth as his jaw was still wired shut. And when the album was leaked on to the internet three months before its release, he took it as a challenge, re-recording all but one track and adding four new ones. He gives the impression that nothing can dent his inestimable reserves of self-confidence, a quality he says has been with since childhood.

"We used to have these talent shows at school," he recalls, "and I would help the others because I just knew I was going to win anyway. The teachers used to say, `This ain't meant to be the Kanye West show.' But now they can't stop me. It's all in the fans' hands."
