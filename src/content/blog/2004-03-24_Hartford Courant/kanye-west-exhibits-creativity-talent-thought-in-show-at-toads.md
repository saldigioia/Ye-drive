# Kanye West Exhibits Creativity, Talent, Thought in Show at Toad's

Quitting school weighs heavily on Kanye West.

The Chicago producer-turned-rapper named his debut “The College Dropout,” and many of the songs he performed Monday night at Toad’s Place in New Haven made defiant reference to having succeeded in the music industry despite not graduating.

Not finishing college is hardly a rarity in the music world, though. Not finishing high school isn’t all that uncommon, in fact.

West would be far more unusual if he actually had a bachelor’s degree — which he clearly doesn’t need.

His lyrics show West to be smart as well as clever, and his success so far — a Top 10 album and several hot singles — doesn’t have much connection with fancy book larnin’.

It does connect, however, to his talent as a producer and lyricist, which has yielded hits for Ludacris and Jay-Z, among others. West’s beats are indicative of music appreciation that goes beyond the overused ‘70s-era funk samples that still turn up on rap records.

He takes a more soul-based approach on “We Don’t Care,” and his show included a keyboard player who added life to canned backing tracks West rapped over.

The pianist brought a gospel feel to “Spaceship,” which began with the old church song “I’ll Fly Away,” and the packed club took on the feel of a revival meeting.

Although West can rhyme with skill about some of the usual hip- hop topics — money, women and weed — he also showed a more thoughtful side.

He rapped on “We Don’t Care” about struggling with poverty and its accompanying statistics on drugs, incarceration and mortality rates.

He got more personal on “Family Business,” rapping about things that are more important than diamonds and gold: family gatherings and the pain of missing relatives who aren’t there because they’ve died or gone to prison.

West also showed a more spiritual side than many rappers do. He asked for guidance on “Jesus Walks,” and the pumped-up bass and noisy crowd couldn’t disguise his socially conscious message.

He’s not so socially conscious that he can’t have fun, though, and that’s where the hits come in. West performed some of his biggest songs in succession toward the end of the set.

His current single, “Slow Jamz,” started with an R&B intro on piano, and the crowd went crazy when the pianist played the song’s main hook.

“Through the Wire,” West’s first hit, followed. He wrote and first recorded the song while his jaw was wired shut after a car accident in 2002.
