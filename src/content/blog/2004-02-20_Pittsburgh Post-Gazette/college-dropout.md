# College Dropout

Debut records don't usually have this much personality, but Kanye West is no newbie. His production work for Jay-Z, Ludacris and Alicia Keys, among others, set sky-high expectations for "College Dropout" and West graduates his first class as a solo artist magna cum laude.

He doesn't arrive with a backstory about getting shot in the hood -- West has a more humorous one about dropping out of college and a near-fatal car accident that required his jaw to be wired shut. Not funny, right? No, but West finds the comedy in that tragedy on the lead-off single, "Through the Wire." Over a sped-up Chaka Khan sample, West raps, "I drink a Boost for breakfast/a Ensure for dizzert/somebody ordered pancakes/I just sip the sizzurp."

The latest MC on Jay-Z's Roc-A-Fella label, West is a man for all seasons, bouncing between party and topical rap and getting principles from both schools, Ludacris and Talib Kweli, to guest.

West sets a satirical tone at the start when, asked for words to inspire the kids at graduation, he breaks into a sing-song chorus of "drug dealing just to get by/stack your money till it get sky high," then goes into an opening track about the absurdity of trying to get by on $6.55 an hour.

Keeping it real (and soulful), West hits topics like education ("We Don't Care"), spirituality ("Jesus Walks") and minimum-wage woes ("Space-ship"), while leaving plenty of room for fun. Kweli pops up after West drops his name while trying to pick up a girl on "Get 'Em High." Then, West comes back with, "I gotta apologize to Mos and Kweli" before summoning Ludacris for what he calls the "bull- - ice rap" of "Breathe In Breathe Out."

To sweeten the deal, West gets one of those winning guest spots from Roc's CEO on "Never Let Me Down" and throws in a slightly re- edited version of "Slow Jamz," his irresistible smash with Twista.

Long before we get to "Last Call" on track 21, West, with his grade-A tracks and lyrical complexity, has convinced us that academia's loss is hip-hop's gain.
