# “That Was Hard to Do, Bro”

## Kanye West’s Fashion Show/Album Release/Conceptual Art Experience

It was Kanye’s third collection of athleisure wear for Adidas, and purportedly a listening party for his seventh solo album.

Many U.S. theaters had sold out, so I snapped up a ticket in a glamorous Virginia suburb of Washington, where only 70 people had skipped out on work early to witness the spectacle, beamed in live from New York’s Madison Square Garden.

We’re sitting in expectant silence, these 70 mostly young men (and one whimpering infant) and I, staring at the empty seats in the Garden.

I’m wondering whether this will be one of those infamous Kanye West fashion shows, whether we’ll all be sitting in this Regal movie theater for hours, until all the Mike & Ikes are gone and we begin to contemplate eating each other.

What exactly have we all — Los Angeles, Bucharest,  Zurich, New York, Alexandria, Va. — ponied up $25 for? Not a stylishly baggy, poo-colored Adidas sweatshirt. Not the album, which has so far been titled and re-titled “So Help Me God,” “Swish,” “Waves” and suddenly, with hours to spare, “The Life of Pablo.”

We don’t know, exactly.

Kanye is an artist searching for depth. We know this because he insists that he’s found it, that it’s all under control, even when it so evidently isn’t, when the album tracks keep changing, when the links for tickets don’t work.

4:15: We get our first, slow pan of … something. It’s the set, covered in a tarp. Are we ready? I think we’re ready.

We’ve handed over our money — some in this theater paid as much as $130 for what can only be described as the Full Kanye Experience — because to be a Kanye fan is to be fully invested, and slightly co-dependent. De’Avis Swann of Brandywine, Md., turned 25 today and says his $130 investment — with the album — “bought me joy.”

You spend half your time listening to him, keeping tabs on his projects, says Frank M. Brown, 27, a life coach. “We spend the other half of our time defending Kanye. I have to own being a fan of Kanye, more than I defend being a fan of anyone else.”

“I don’t think fans are getting tired of him,” says Brown. “I think people who don’t like Kanye are getting tired of him.”

4:35: Kanye appears. With Lamar Odom. (This is the first appearance of the former NBA star and estranged Kardashian spouse since he was found unconscious and hospitalized for three months.) The theater is going wild. “Like, he’s alive!” one guy in the theater is saying. The sound is finally on.

I’d like to take this moment to note that Kanye West has turned up at his New York Fashion Week show dressed a little like Tiger Woods, in a red sweatshirt and a black ball cap.

He’s positioned himself behind a laptop. Rappers Pusha T and Travis Scott are with him.

The religion-tinged opening track seems fitting for the opening moments, for the gravity of this moment, or at least for the gravity he wants us to feel.

4:43: The tarp is off!

4:56: One of Kanye’s rhymes points out that he and Ray J have something in common. Except Kanye’s rich. The crowd is eating this up. This album: better than TMZ.

“I’ve been thinking/about my vision,” he’s singing. We in the Regal movie theater audience are thinking about this vision, too. This Ye army, which seems to have been instructed to look as grim as possible. Models always look grim, but why, when it’s a roomful of models of color, is it so easy to read into this grimness? (Does Veronica Webb look slightly frightened?) It’s a visual match for a record that so far seems to be laden with ennui. At the raising of fists, the audience in the theater is silent.

5:14: “Did I deliver on my promise of the album? Tell me how you all feel about the show this season,” Kanye asks, waiting even, for an answer.

“You think,” he asks in response to the echo chamber of silence, “this s— is easy to do?” One of the hardest things to do,” he said, was to get fashion people “to come roll with a rapper.”

5:19: We think it is over. Now it is time to make some noise, for Olivier (you know, Rousteing, the creative director of Balmain. Get with it).

No wait, there’s more! He’s taking requests from the new album.

Wait, we have a new soundtrack. Now we’re hearing the new Young Thug, and the crowd at Madison Square Garden is moving.

The models are staying in character, as are the Kardashians, who are dressed – by Olivier – like Josie Geller from “Never Been Kissed.” Do they know this?

5:30: It’s hard to say this: The Great Unwashed Ye Army is more interesting than the Ye banter. He just announced that the album is a gospel album. And now he’s ready, he says, to keep going. Will the listening party turn into a DJ night?

The audience in the movie theater is cutting up. Kanye West just announced that he also worked on a video game. A game about his mother. The video game is called “The Only One” and it is about his mother going to Heaven. “No, you don’t understand,” West is saying. “That was hard to do, bro.”

The audience in the movie theater is losing it. Afterward some expressed remorse that they laughed, because it was about Kanye’s mother.

If you don’t believe he is a fashion designer, he points out that he has the No. 1 shoe. “The No. 1 Christmas present.” And, he’d like to be creative director of Hermes.

No, I am not mistaken: This is the second time we’re hearing some of these songs. The audience in the movie theater is now singing along. Particularly to lyrics about Ray J.

The models were playing a role, but now I am pretty sure they are just bored. Did Vanessa Beecroft, a veteran conceptual artist who has helped to add visual heft to Kanye’s work since 2008, and most memorably on his 2013 Yeezus tour — explain that this would be an endurance work?

5:44: They just cut the live stream. The audience is cracking up. “Wow,” one guy says, “that was significant.”

Devin Harris, 21, and Nile Kendall, 20, both Howard students, walk out invigorated, if slightly confused. “It was crazy, it was very artful,” says Harris.

Kendall saw it as necessary marketing in an era when, he says, “we’re no longer going to the store and buying the CD.”

So maybe Kanye is a genius, or at least pretty smart, to sell an experience. Across the country, people were buying.
