# Kanye on Keyboards

## How a Master Rapper-Producer Is Remixing Social Media.

In 2001, years before the word “blog” came into heavy rotation, Mariah Carey used the Web to alert her fans that she was suffering an existential crisis. Carey’s bulletin — “I don’t know what’s going on with life” — took the form of an MP3 audio file that showed up on her official Web site. For those who had the bandwidth to play it, it seemed like a gash on a stage scrim: a frightening, thrilling break in the artifice of stardom. In those days, celebrities weren’t supposed to confide in us.

Though it wasn’t clear at the time, the confession, which was widely called “bizarre” and “rambling” in the press, was also a glittering nugget of intellectual property. Carey’s latest single wasn’t selling well, and her movie was tanking, but people were clicking their keyboards like mad to listen to evidence of her turbulent emotional life.

The days of celebrities’ coming unraveled in plain view, or even coming into plain view at all, had not yet arrived. The thesis of the celebrity weeklies that stars are just like us — or, ideally, worse was not yet big business. The ‘90s were the era of monster publicists, managers and agents, a time when a star’s album, concert, movie, book or TV show — not her emotional life — was seen as her biggest commodity. Certainly no one was predicting that in 2007 a futuristic celebrity ringmaster like Kanye West would make online self-disclosure the rule and not the exception, creating a masterpiece blog, building an online gallery of art and design and showcasing it in a stunning Web site that would improbably cross memoir and mall.

That’s right: this is Kanye UniverseCity, a stylized, sci-fi map of the impresario’s brain created with help from Takashi Murakami, the Japanese artist and exponent of global fan-geek culture. The site looks nothing like the Web forays of other rap figures: Nas, Lil Wayne and 50 Cent use shadowy photographs of themselves in dark-alley spaces leavened mostly by sparkling Champagne bottles and fist-size diamonds. Let’s break it down: they’re rich, and they can kill you.

By contrast, the conceit of Kanye UniverseCity is a crayon-colored cartoon cityscape - an ever-expanding metropolis on the order of Shanghai. Click on features of the city, and up come chances to live the Kanye life, which is stylish, roguish, worldly, tech-savvy and socially responsible. Naturally you can buy its trappings and contribute to its causes. (West has recently turned his attention to traumatized veterans of the war in Iraq.) The site is also the place to go for West’s trademark outbursts. Responding to rumors that he was in therapy, he wrote, “I get off the plane in Hawaii today and the world is saying my management team said blah blah blah ... SIIIIIIGGGHHHH! I told the media you can’t make up lies about me because I have a media outlet myself. Oh and sidebar I don’t know if everyone has realized this yet but I don’t do interviews if there’s anything I wanna say I’ll say right here on my own blog.”

The UniverseCity blog is chocked with impulsive aperçus, including a furious explanation of his (late and booed) appearance at the Bonnaroo music festival on June 15. “This is the most offended I’ve ever been,” he wrote, “this is the maddest I ever will be. I’m typing so” — he used an intensifier — “hard I might break my” — intensifier again — “Mac book Air!!!!!!!!”

West sounded mad. But less mad, maybe, than OutKast when they rapped in 1994, “The Glock, the gat, the nine, the heaters/See I be bustin caps like my amp be bustin speakers” in “Ain’t No Thang.” A gangster with a Mac-10 clearly beats a blogger with a MacBook - but only man to man, and only in the neighborhood. What if the goal is world domination? It’s been an innovation and a risk for West to embrace dandified clothes, Japanese cartoons, a circus palette and geek culture. But with the global Asian fusion of Kanye UniverseCity - along with the staggering eclecticism of his music - West has acquired a tremendous following and fortune. He has also all but abandoned the meanstreets regionalism that used to confine hip-hop, when artists boasted chiefly about their loyalty to Brooklyn, Detroit, Atlanta or Compton.

West’s site is also just fun. On the blog, West serves as an all-seeing coolhunter, turning up a range of favorite things - German art installatons, limited-edition Parisian fashion, an iPod remote control worn like a wedding ring. (“Avant garde” is a category on the site.) For now, West styles himself as a hip and male answer to Oprah Winfrey, a cultural curator with incalculable influence over an audience that he alone has united. And if Oprah, whose O Magazine pushes cashmere sweaters and melamine bowls, is the Smithsonian, West is the Whitney.

West, who is known for a passionate and all-cap prose style, has bridled at the suggestion, recently floated in the press, that he uses a ghost-blogger to compose his impersonal entries. In response, West released a photo that shows him at work on his three-pound Air, one of a dozen or so photos that show his studio full of handsome lounge lizards, most bowed over laptops while seated in leather couches and Aerons. WiFi charges the air as cigarette smoke did in an earlier era.

Maybe this heady and abstract space is the perfect home for an artist for whom music has always been bytes of information rather than strings, keys or record grooves. West’s father was a Black Panther and a photojournalist, but West also comes from an academic background. His mother was chairwoman of the English department at Chicago State University, where West himself was briefly a student. He has evolved a personal iconography that centers on university life. His albums — “The College Dropout” (2004), “Late Registration” (2005) and “Graduation” (2007) — are each adorned with a mascot in the Murakami mode: a goggle-eyed, perky-eared bear sometimes dressed as an old-fashioned collegian, in a blazer with a school insignia. This is Dropout Bear.

Dropout Bear, minus the uniform, also figures prominently in Kanye UniverseCity. Watching his head spin atop a building antenna on the cartoon skyline, you can’t quite tell whether he’s an idol or a beheaded enemy rotating on a spit. The wacko science fiction is not easy to parse here, but it’s intriguing, and repays regular attention. Perhaps West, together with Murakami, means to make his name in a new twilight of the idols — a Nietzschean event suggested by UniverseCity, the cartoon Sodom?

On the other hand, maybe Kanye the sci-fi hero just likes the good life. On July 29, West posted the video of “Disperse,” by the hip-hop star Consequence, in which West has a cameo. The song turns the crowd-control phrase “please disperse” into a lordly rap star’s insistence on sex with his groupies. (The chorus instructs girls to scatter if they’re not into sex.) The video looks amateurish. Boys mug at the camera, girls pout in shiny makeup, nothing is consistently lighted.

In the commentary on the site, posters with names like ElNegro and LouisVuittonDona offer gaga praise — “dope song, dope video’ — but also gossip about the video’s players as if they were all friends. One note, a desperate plea for emotional support, reads as if it were for West alone. It’s worrying, actually, a sad girl’s lament about a cruel boyfriend.

West’s reply was nowhere, but the commenter soon resurfaced, suggesting the star had been in touch. Perhaps West wrote her a private message. In any case, and somehow, the superstar seemed to have magically healed her.

“U r funny K,” she wrote, “i’m fine now.”
