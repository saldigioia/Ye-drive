# Kanye West, Superstar? He Thinks So

Kanye West tries for some predictable shock on the cover of Rolling Stone by posing as Jesus Christ.

Photographed in a crown of thorns by professional provocateur David LaChapelle, the rapper can be seen with "blood" trickling down his face.

They're apparently borrowing the idea Sean Combs had in 1999, when he shot a mock crucifixion for a Nas video. Back then, Puffy had second thoughts about aping his Savior. When the video made it on to MTV, he and two bodyguards beat up the music exec he held responsible. (A law-suit was settled out of court.)

But yesterday, usually outraged Catholic League gadfly William Donohue had trouble working up much spleen over the Kanye- LaChapelle stunt.

"This kind of thing has become commonplace," Donohue told us, recalling a crucifixion gambit pulled by People for the Ethical Treatment for Animals. "It's one thing to rip off Catholic iconography. It's quite another to exploit a poor soul like Kanye West. Anyone who is this morally and mentally challenged deserves our sympathy not our derision."

A rep for the mag said, "Rolling Stone covers have always been an outlet for artistic expression; we certainly do not intend to offend religious groups, or anyone else for that matter."

In his interview with the mag, the man who recorded "Jesus Walks" confesses that he suffers from an "addiction" to porn. He remembers first seeing his father's Playboy magazine when he was 5 years old. "Right then," West says, laughing, "it was like, 'Houston, we have a problem.'"

Not that West, who is partial to gawking at Booty Talk, wants for real flesh. Rolling Stone says he frequently turns to his "light- skinned and leggy" girlfriend, Brooke Crittendon, for feedback on his tracks.

Having dated him for more than a year, the 24-year-old assistant at MTV says: "I don't think we've ever been apart longer than seven days."

How does their relationship work? "By the grace of God," she says.

Does she trust him? "If someone makes an agreement, I expect them to honor it."

They have matching gold Bulgari watches.

"I trust him," she says. "He's got so much going on, but he never makes me feel like I'm No. 2."

Nominated for eight Grammies, West doesn't see why people knock him for acting like he's the Second Coming.

"In America, they want you to accomplish these great feats, to pull off these David Copperfield-type stunts," he says. "You want me to be great, but you don't ever want me to say I'm great?"
