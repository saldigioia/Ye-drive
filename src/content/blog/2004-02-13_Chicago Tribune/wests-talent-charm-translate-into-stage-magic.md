# West's Talent, Charm, Translate Into Stage Magic

Kanye West was trying to act natural but something in that Chicago background was making a bashful smile flash up and his eyes dart down. Chicago’s greatest rap hero, Common, was onstage telling the first of two sold-out audiences at the House of Blues Wednesday night that West had “singlehandedly brought hip hop to another level.”

Such praise for an album that only dropped Tuesday?

While the world may not know it quite yet, West has produced and rapped his way through a hip-hop classic on his debut, “The College Dropout.” The expected criticism of any rapper/producer, that they’re tackling too many things at once, simply doesn’t hold water on “Dropout.”

Perhaps this is because West produces records where the production and samples talk to the artists, instead of just one-way monologues for someone to rap over. And the dialogue is witty and above all, candid. Equal parts inspiration and calculation, West seems to see no disjoint in reconciling with God and creating mock exercise tapes, such as, “All them mocha lattes/You got to do Pilates.”

So as other rappers pose and posture themselves into cartoons, West, perhaps from watching the many rappers he has done production for, seems to realize that by being himself, an awkward, funny, highly musical midwesterner, he can separate himself from the pack.

And West was himself Wednesday, occasionally to a fault. He wore a salmon sport jacket, white shoes, and a diamond necklace, looking more “Miami Vice” than Roc-A-Fella nice. But one minute he would spit a line as jaw-dropping as “I want to talk to God but I’m afraid ‘cause we ain’t spoke in so long,” from “Jesus Walks.” And the next, he would gleefully sing along to all the hit records he’s produced, like a young fan, alone in his bedroom.

With violinist Miri Ben-Ari, extraordinary keyboardist/singer, John Legend, and a DJ, the question was whether we were seeing West’s generosity or his insecurity as a performer. Although he could learn something from the live fire of Common, he charmed the audience with the honesty and candidness from the record.

He also seemed to relish the chance to talk about the mindless jobs he went through before his rise to the top. On “Spaceship,” instead of simply imagining a violent confrontation, a la Eminem, West transcended his boring job by dreaming up an escape by spaceship.

The middle-class touchstones that West references, from “Everybody Loves Raymond,” to a disdain for higher education, will no doubt endear him to a broad audience but he seemed to have no problem appealing to a diverse room Wednesday.
