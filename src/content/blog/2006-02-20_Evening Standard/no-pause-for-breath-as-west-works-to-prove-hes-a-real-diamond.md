# No Pause for Breath as West Works to Prove He's a Real Diamond

## Kanye West at Hammersmith Apollo

Fresh from multi-gonged glory at the Grammy Awards and again at last week’s Brits, rapper Kanye West brought a spectacular show to an ecstatic crowd at Hammersmith Apollo last night. He radiated confidence and success as he bounded around the stage, sometimes sporting his trademark Luis Vuitton Millionaire sunglasses but, to his credit, this never degenerated into complacency or open arrogance. Rather, it seemed to spur him on to justify his elevated status with a world-class performance.

“Y’all been standing in the rain for two hours; so I ain’t gonna walk around the stage like I’m cool as hell.

I’m going to perform for you like you’d been waiting for three hours,” the Atlanta-born star promised, to wild screams of approval. And he was as good as his word, giving his all for the best part of two hours with barely a minute’s break.

Opening with Diamonds From Sierra Leone, West was backed by strings, adding an epic feel alongside a sample of Shirley Bassey singing Diamonds Are Forever. A sea of glowing camera phones (which have long since replaced lighters as illuminated-things to wave) seemed to create-a reflection of the diamond-themed visuals behind him as he rapped from the heart about “conflict diamonds”.

About 40 minutes into the show, the strings, smoochy backing vocals and cunning visuals were starting to wear a little thin, certainly for those who were expecting somewhat grittier hiphop. A breathtaking scratch-DJ-ing interlude from Canadian turntable demon, A-Trak, introduced a welcome selection of his tougher tracks.

Often characterized as a cerebral rapper who makes his listeners think, the truth about Kanye West is more complex. Diamonds From Sierra Leone may inspire some to think about the miserable journey that takes jewels from chaotic war zones to the rich. But he still sports diamonds himself.

But he can keep the hardcore rap fans happy, while still appealing to the mainstream, and the hardestworking man in rap proved that he can do the same with a live audience.
