# Kanye West’s S.F. Show a Family Affair With Performances by Daughter North

Make way for Miss Westie. 

Kanye West’s 10-year-old daughter North West proved that music truly is a “family business” at the “Vultures 1” listening experience at San Francisco’s Chase Center on Tuesday, March 12. 

The young artist, whose mother is Skims founder Kim Kardashian, refers to herself as “Miss Westie” on the track “Talking” from “Vultures 1” — the first collaborative album between West, who now goes by Ye, and Ty Dolla Sign, collectively billed ¥$ — and stole the show as she briefly joined her father in the spotlight.  

Indeed, it was a family affair. Ye and Kardashian’s three other children — Chicago, Psalm and Saint — were there to cheer on their sister, along with their mother and Ye’s current wife, architect and model Bianca Censori. The event marked Censori and Kardashian’s first public appearance together.

As with previous “Vultures 1” performances, which began last month ahead of the album’s release on Feb. 10, North performed for the San Francisco crowd a second time to unveil her new feature on the unreleased track “Matthew.” The song is expected to be included on ¥$’s anticipated sequel album “Vultures 2.” 

While the preteen rapper had announced that her debut album, “Elementary School Dropout,” inspired by her father’s 2004 debut, “The College Dropout,” is in the works just a few nights before at the Phoenix listening experience on Sunday, March 10, she didn’t tease any tracks for the Bay Area crowd.

Tuesday night’s show had gotten off to a stirring start. Awash in a sea of black clothing and baggy hoodies, on par with Ye’s style, fans flooded the home of the Golden State Warriors when doors opened at 8 p.m., many rushing to the merch stands to grab a $20 T-shirt with the “Vultures” crest on it before settling into their seats.

Despite the spacious venue appearing half-empty leading up to the show, by the time Ye and Ty Dolla Sign came out — roughly 20 minutes behind schedule — the arena was packed and brimming with energy. 

In typical Ye fashion, he performed amid a minimalist setting, with no stage and virtually nothing in the center of the arena except a large circular piece of white fabric suspended in midair. Throughout the night, Ye and Ty Dolla Sign bounced around the floor, shrouded in smoke as they danced to the prerecorded music while a live video feed of them was projected onto the floating fabric. Both were dressed in all-black ensembles complete with matching full-face balaclavas and hockey masks that they didn’t remove until midway through the night. 

New York rapper Rich the Kid also hit the floor, making an appearance for his part on the track “Carnival.”

“It almost felt like a movie in there,” 31-year-old Sergio Gonzales said of the hazy spectacle as he left the arena. 

Gonzales and his friend Frankie Mora, 32, traveled from Monterey for the listening party. Both of them said they have followed Ye since childhood and have stayed loyal to the Chicago-born rapper despite the controversies he’s sparked over the years, from spewing antisemitic comments to wearing a MAGA hat and sporting a “White Lives Matter” T-shirt.  

“We’re pretty dedicated fans, we don’t involve politicians or religion or anything like that,” Mora said. “We’re here for the sound.” 

They aren’t the only ones. Upon its release last month, the 16-track “Vultures 1” record debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and has grossed an estimated $12 million in ticket sales for similar listening events in Chicago, New York, Las Vegas, Phoenix and parts of Europe. The album is a blend of heavy rap songs and melodic anthems, reminiscent of some of Ye’s earlier music, showcasing his range yet maintaining more cohesion than many of his more recent projects. 

“People may think he’s crazy, but I think I’m just as crazy as him, so I relate,” said Lilian Estelavaliente, 24, of Fairfield. Having grown up listening to Ye’s music with her older sister, she described the night as “reliving childhood dreams.”

After running through most of “Vultures 1,” Ye and Ty Dolla Sign left the center of the floor, returning a few minutes later to preview parts of “Vultures 2.” This time Ye appeared with a new jacket, emblazoned with “2” on the back in a nod to the forthcoming record. (“Vultures 2” was originally slated for release Friday, March 8, but has been delayed. No further updates have been announced.)

To end the night, Ye ran through fan favorites much like Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour, filling the final set with hits spanning his career, from 2007’s “Can’t Tell Me Nothing” to 2010’s “Runaway” and 2016’s “Fade.” Each song infused new energy into the crowd, prompting fans to chant along. 

It all ended rather abruptly around 11:20 p.m. after a short snippet of 2008’s “Heartless.” For some, the night was still young, and joining Ty Dolla Sign at Temple nightclub for the official after-party was the next stop. For others, witnessing Ye’s artistry was more than enough. 

“He gave us everything we wanted,” said James Fukuda, 23, who drove up from San Jose.

“And more,” his friend Josh Velo, 25, chimed in. “He exceeded our expectations.”
