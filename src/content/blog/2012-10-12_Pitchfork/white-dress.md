# “White Dress”

You’ve probably heard more than a few Wu-Tang diehards bemoaning pretty much everything Kanye West’s done since The College Dropout, hoping that one day, he might ditch the French horns, Auto-Tune and Hawaiian recording studio and take it all back to 2003. That’s the guy who shows up on “White Dress,” a striking, for-the-love track featuring a RZA-helmed (rather than RZA-inspired) soul beat and ‘Ye’s typically goofy and endearing punchlines (“tell Peaches light the herb ‘cause we just reunited”). It’s hard to imagine a RZA-helmed flick — particularly one named The Man With the Iron Fists — inspiring the lyrics here, so given the situation and the people involved, “White Dress” is an enjoyable surprise. Honoring his surroundings and collaborators, West doesn’t go out of his way to steal the show, for once. But the funny thing is, it happens anyway.
