# How West Is Winning

## He's Laid Down Beats for Jay-Z and Ludacris. Now the Ex-South Sider Wants His Own Spotlight.

To get to Roc-A-Fella, Jay-Z's hip-hop empire, they say you have to pay your dues.

Kanye West paid his on Chicago's South Side, making beats as early as 4th grade and jumping into rap circles at recess.

As years passed and demo tapes accumulated, West's finesse with updating classic soul samples and adding just the right amount of boom-bap to make heads snap finally landed him some attention. His beats have become the foundation for countless hits, including Jay Z's "Izzo (H.O.V.A.)," Ludacris' "Stand Up," Alicia Keys' "You Don't Know My Name" and, recently, fellow Chicagoan Twista's "Slow Jams."

The 26-year-old was spending so much time behind Roc-A-Fella's production boards, the label decided to add him to its roster. And when execs found out his skills extended to the microphone, they signed him. West's debut album, "College Dropout," hit stores Tuesday.

**When you were building up steam in Chicago as a producer and rapper, where were your favorite haunts?**

I'd take my tapes anywhere. The barbershop was really a hot spot for that. For freestyle battles, I'd go to various clubs. I went to the Dragon Room (809 W. Evergreen Ave.) a lot to battle.

**Where did the name for your debut, "College Dropout," come from?**

I dropped out of college twice. The first time while on a scholarship at the American Academy of Art. After that, I went to Chicago State University as an English major and ended up dropping out of there, too. My mom was the head of the English department there, so you know how that went over.

**Your video for the song "Through the Wire" chronicles your experience of having your mouth wired shut after a car accident. Did you resort to throwing burgers in the blender?**

It's pretty much like the song says, "I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert. Somebody order pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp."

**In the video it looks like there are a few shots of the South Side's famous Leon's. Any Chicago spots that you particularly miss now that you live in New York?**

Leon's is definitely the spot for ribs. And I can't get anything close to Harold's Chicken Shack in New York.

**What kind of reaction do you get from people in your old neighborhood now that you're blowing up?**

My mom is definitely proud that I've made it. But a lot of people want to be down with me now that weren't before. I definitely go back and kick it in the old neighborhood. My friends who were my friends before all of this [fame] are still very much in my life.
