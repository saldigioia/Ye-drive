# Rapper's Rise

## From South Side to Top of Charts

It wasn’t enough for South Side native Kanye West to emerge as one of the hottest, most respected producers in pop music in the last few years. He was determined to become a rapper and star in his own right, as well, and not even a nearly fatal accident could stand in his way.

In October 2002, he was in a car crash in Los Angeles that shattered his face. With his jaw wired shut, his veins saturated with pain killers and infection-fighting drugs, West recorded the vocals for “Through the Wire,” the song that set him on the path to recovery, and to his first solo album, “College Dropout” (Roc-A- Fella), out this week.

“I was mad because I was not being taken seriously as a rapper for a long time,” says West, who headlines two concerts Wednesday at House of Blues. “Whether it was because I didn’t have a larger-than- life persona, or I was perceived as the guy who made beats, I was disrespected as a rapper. I was making good beats before I made good raps, but I’ve been rapping for longer. It’s hard to rap, man. You can’t accidentally rap well, but you can accidentally make a good beat. Accidents -- weird, right? An accident changed my life.”

As West regained consciousness in a Los Angeles hospital, “lines started coming into my head,” he says.

> How do you console my mom or give her light support

> Telling her your son’s on life support

For West’s mother, Donda West, an English professor at Chicago State University, the call came at 5 a.m. that her son had been in a terrible accident. She was on a plane to Los Angeles three hours later. “I never thought he’d die,” she says. “I had to push those thoughts out of my mind.”

She stayed with him in Los Angeles while he recovered. “He came up with a healthy respect for God, but the accident had a profound impact on him,” she says. “He particularly knows that by the grace of God he was spared, and spared for a particular purpose. I’ve never witnessed him as a card-carrying Christian -- he’s just too hip-hop for that -- but I think he has an appreciation for the fact that he could have been dead, and he feels there are angels watching him and protecting him.”

For the producer-turned-rapper, “Through the Wire” was a turning point. “That song made all the difference,” he says. “It opened up people to hearing what else this guy could do. I thought even if the song didn’t blow up, it would go down in history as one of the best hip-hop songs ever because it was real.”

More than a year later, Donda West says her son is still recovering from his injuries. “The initial healing process took about two months, and it was excruciatingly painful,” she says. “The process since has been slow. But he couldn’t be kept down.”

Until the success of “Through the Wire” and the release of “College Dropout,” West was best known as a beats maestro whose imprint is on hits by Jay-Z, Britney Spears, Mos Def, Talib Kweli and Alicia Keys, among dozens of others. Last week, the hit he wrote and produced for Chicago rapper Twista, “Slow Jamz,” was in the top 5, and Twista’s album, “Kamikaze,” debuted at No. 1. “College Dropout” is expected to follow suit.

West was born 26 years ago on the South Side to Donda and Ray West, a Black Panther who became an award-winning photojournalist and most recently a pastoral marriage counselor. West’s parents separated when he was 11 months old, and were divorced when he was 3, but the boy maintained a relationship with his father and often spent summers with him. Donda West nurtured her son in myriad ways, encouraging his gifts as a visual artist, for which he eventually earned a college scholarship, and budding poet.

“We were coming back from a short vacation in Michigan when he was 5 and he composed a poem in the back seat,” she says. “The one line that sticks with me is `the trees are melting black.’ It was late fall, and the trees had no leaves. He saw how those limbs were etched against the sky, and he described them the way a poet would.”

Young Kanye spent a year with his mother in China while she was teaching English at Nanching University. The 10-year-old would make money by break-dancing on the streets for the locals. “He was an entrepreneur even then,” she says.

While attending Polaris High School on the South Side, he struck up an acquaintance with the producer No I.D., who was then working with a future star named Common Sense (who later shortened his name to Common). Kanye would have his mother drive him to No I.D.’s house, where he’d soak up knowledge at the producer’s basement studio. At 15, Kanye acquired his first sampling keyboard. Between the tutorials from No I.D., whom West would refer to as his “almost stepfather,” and incessant tinkering, rapping and beatmaking in his bedroom, West developed his skills as a producer and rapper. His first break came in 1998 when he sold a beat to Atlanta producer Jermaine Dupri for his “Life in 1472” album, and West’s life as a college student who would follow in his mother’s multiple-degree footsteps became an afterthought.

“It was drummed into my head that college is the ticket to a good life,” Donda West says, “but some career goals don’t require college. For Kanye to make an album called `College Dropout,’ it was more about having the guts to embrace who you are, rather than following the path society has carved out for you. And that’s what Kanye did.”

Soon the non-stop traffic in the fledgling producer’s apartment studio in Chicago became too much for his landlord, and in 2001 West packed his bags for the East Coast, first settling in Newark, N.J., and finally a $3,000-a-month apartment in Hoboken, across the river from New York City.

There he began supplying beats to some of the biggest names in hip-hop, including Jay-Z, who pried open the door for a deal at the Roc-A-Fella label. “I was definitely intimidated, because Jay-Z is a superstar, and one of my idols,” West says. “But even if he told me one of my beats stinks, it wouldn’t have crushed me. I still got real high self-esteem.”

The mix of a down-to-earth Midwestern work ethic and a self- confidence bordering on arrogance is what makes West such an arresting new figure in rap. “College Dropout” is his warts-and-all story, told from an outsider perspective, the street-smart kid who doesn’t pretend to be a gangster, gangbanger or high roller flaunting his diamonds and luxury cars. Instead, he works for minimum wage at a retail store, the would-be ladies man who dares to “talk about God” even though it might mean his “record won’t get played.” And when he sinks into the world of “crunk” (southern, bass heavy style) funk, he does it with a sense of humor, belittling himself for succumbing to temptation: “Always said if I rapped I’d say something significant but now I’m rapping about money, hoes and rims again.”

He’s a deft wordsmith, a rapper with the ability to change the direction of his flow at the drop of a pun. “College Dropout” blows out hip-hop borders with string sections, gospel choirs and the speeded-up old-school beats that have become West’s production signature. “I saved the best tracks for my own album,” West says with a chuckle. “Rap is my first love, but there are so many other facets of rapping that I wanted as part of this record. The main thing is message and melody, even more so than rapping. I do as much singing on this record as I do rapping.”

In tracks such as “I’ll Fly Away,” “Two Words,” “All Falls Down” and “We Don’t Care,” West offers a critique and celebration of a world defined by hip-hop values. “College Dropout” is the portrait of a young African-American struggling with new responsibilities in the guise of an ambitious and vividly arranged album that invokes hip-hop excess, soul beats, gospel hosannahs, classical orchestrations and pop sizzle. It’s a world where “Jesus walks” alongside frustrated crack dealers, a world more real, in other words, than that portrayed in many hip-hop records striving for chart dominance.

“It was important for me to rap about a real person, instead of a cartoon,” West says. “I grew into this person, and that’s who I am as a rapper. It’s like everybody in the room is wearing gold jewelry, and I walk in with a suit on. That’s the best way to get noticed.”
