# Producers Who Won't Stay in the Booth

What do you call a hip-hop producer with a microphone? A bad idea, more often than not: most of them are better off letting the professionals handle the vocals. And yet three of this season’s most exciting new releases come from vocalist-producers who seem to think they can do everything, and they just might be right.

Kanye West, from Chicago, is known for wistful, playful beats, including Jay-Z’s “Izzo (H.O.V.A.),” Cam’ron’s “Dead or Alive” and Talib Kweli’s “Get By,” which borrowed a few notes from Nina Simone to create a track fit for double-dutch.

Mr. West has also released one of the year’s best hip-hop mixtapes, “I’m Good,” a collection of remixes and freestyles that showed him to be a clever and sometimes slick rapper. On “Through the Wire,” said to have been recorded after a car accident left Mr. West’s jaw wired shut, he poked mushmouthed fun at his own condition: “I drink a Boost for breakfast, a Ensure for dessert/ Somebody order pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp/ That right there could drive a sane man berserk/ Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo’s back to wizzork.”

His debut album, “College Dropout,” is due out sometime before Christmas from Roc-A-Fella/Island Def Jam, and early evidence is encouraging. One track likely to appear is “Two Words,” a rousing posse cut costarring Mos Def, Freeway and the Boys Choir of Harlem.

Dizzee Rascal’s marvelous debut album, “Boy in da Corner,” is something else altogether: his squeaky rhymes and severe electronic beats confound at first, but grow more addictive with each listen. The album was released in July in Dizzee’s native England; with any luck, an intrepid American label will see fit to release it sooner rather than later.

Early next year, the hip-hop producers Chad Hugo and Pharrell Williams (known as the Neptunes) are to release their second album with N.E.R.D., their rock ’n’ roll band. The two have helped create an astonishing number of great songs over the last few years, and yet each new triumph feels like a happy accident. With any luck, the new album will be deceptively simple, willfully goofy and utterly irresistible.
