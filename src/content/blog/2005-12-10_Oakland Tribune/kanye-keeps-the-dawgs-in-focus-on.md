# Kanye Keeps the Dawgs In, Focus On

Fans in San Jose witnessed what is arguably, and unfortunately, the rarest feat in all of pop music on Wednesday night: They saw a big-name hip-hop show that was completely void of cliches.

Megastar Kanye West didn’t ask the folks at HP Pavilion to put their hands in the air and wave them like they just don’t care. He didn’t have us say “hey” or “ho,” nor did he take the time to remember Tupac, Biggie or any other “fallen soldier.”

He didn’t tear off his shirt halfway through the show, partake in any tiresome call-and-response with the crowd or turn the mic over to members of his posse.

Most significantly, he never posed the query, “Where’s my dawgs at?”

By keeping the focus squarely on the music, the incomparable West — nominated earlier this week for eight Grammy Awards — managed to come across as well in concert as he does on record.

How many other big-name rappers can boast that claim? Certainly not Eminem, Jay-Z and 50 Cent, all of whom routinely let cliches and poor planning drag down their live shows.

Perhaps that’s why Kanye West is the current king of the hip-hop heap. And, based on his showing in San Jose, things should only get better for the 28-year-old Atlanta native.

The show opened with sets by soul singers Keyshia Cole and Fantasia, the 2004 “American Idol” champ. Following in the footsteps of Kelly Clarkson and Clay Aiken, Fantasia has done a good job parlaying her small-screen fame into a successful start in the pop music world. Her debut CD, “Free Yourself,” entered the Billboard charts at No. 8 in November 2004, and her self-affirming R&B anthem “I Believe” was the best-selling single of last year.

To top it off, Fantasia’s inspirational memoir, 2004’s “Life is Not a Fairy Tale,” managed to hit No.7 on the New York Times best-seller list.

Yet the 21-year-old singer from High Point, N.C., clearly has a way to go before her ability as a live performer matches her otherwise impressive resume. Her performance felt forced and unnatural, and her choice of cover material — Aerosmith’s “Dream On” and Prince’s “Purple Rain” — was far too obvious. In general, she came across like she was still performing in front of the three- headed tribunal of Simon, Paula and Randy.

Common was also originally scheduled on the bill, but the rapper had to drop off the tour after landing a role in the upcoming film “Smoking Aces.” That turned out to be a good thing, since it gave Mr. West more room to work.

It was obvious from the moment the curtains parted and the crowd saw the classical-style string section onstage that this was to be a different kind of hip-hop show. Over the course of just two songs, it also became blatantly clear that this was to be one of the best hip-hop shows in memory. (It easily ranks as one of the top five rap concerts that this critic has seen over the past 10 years.)

The rapper hit the ignition with a towering version of “Touch the Sky,” from 2005’s “Late Registration,” and then kicked it into high gear for the sing-along street-anthem “We Don’t Care” from 2004’s land

mark “The College Dropout.” From that strong starting point on, the show never lost momentum — again, a true rarity in the rap world.

The unusual musical marriage of string section and hip-hop vocals worked perfectly, adding both drama and a sense of struggle to songs such as “The New Workout Plan” and “Addiction.” The sound was further enriched by some deft DJ work, solid backup vocals and a few guest rappers, who appeared, thankfully, only when it made sense.

As the 90-minute performance continued, West kept right on making smart decisions. He played musical samples, all of which were clever, original and well-received, but never allowed that avenue to draw the focus away from his own material. He introduced a few storylines to the show, none of which felt forced or unnecessary.

Even the one tirade from this tirade-prone superstar — when he refused to play a song until all the TVs in the luxury boxes were turned off — was quite amusing.

West made nearly every song sound like a greatest hit. But he was still able to somehow up the ante when it came time to play the actual chart-busters.

The live version of “The College Dropout”-smash “Slow Jamz” — despite the absence of vocalists Twista and Jamie Foxx — was a knockout. But it paled in comparison to West’s thunderous take on the new album’s “Gold Digger.” That tune might just be the best single of 2005. Believe it or not, it even sounded stronger in concert.

The concert drew to a close as West waltzed out his signature track, “Jesus Walks,” and then put a shine on the new album’s “Diamonds From Sierra Leone.” As the megastar left the stage, everyone in the house seemed to know that they had just witnessed the hip-hop show of the year. And West didn’t need to use one single cliche to accomplish that feat.

That, dawg, is where it’s at.
