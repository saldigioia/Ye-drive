# Inside Kim’s Wedding

## The Gowns, the Vows, the 7-Foot-Tall Cake: Us Has All the Details

Even those who don't keep up with Kim Kardashian knew her plans for May 24. After months of fevered speculation and exasperated eye rolls (How many designer dresses would she wear? Did her fiancé really commission a Versailles flyover? Will the media ever stop talking about this?), the 33-year-old two-time divorcée finally wed her Givenchy-clad Prince Charming, Kanye West, 37, at a 16th century fortress in Florence, Italy. With 200 guests looking on, the bride, wearing Givenchy Haute Couture, strutted solo down the aisle - stepdad Bruce Jenner, 64, waited at the end to give her away - as Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli sang "Ave Maria."

After the parents of 11-month-old North exchanged traditional vows, the crowd was ushered into a candlefilled reception room for the grand finale to the three-day, two-country, $12 million-plus affair - only part of which was filmed by E! But no matter how well planned the evening (Place cards? Please: Guests' names were inscribed in 24-karat gold in a 230-foot marble dining table), there was, of course, drama. Us answers the burning questions, including who dined, who ditched - and which unlikely twosome hooked up.

### Where Were Bey and Jay?

The most famous invitees bailed, in part, because of guest Rachel Roy. When Jay Z, 44, last saw the designer at the Met Gala, sister-in-law Sob ange Knowles accused him of getting flirty, and the infamous Elevator Incident ensued. Not interested in a second run-in, he and Beyoncé, 32, skipped in favor of a trip to New York's Hamptons. "They didn't want to detract from Kanye's day," explains a source. The plan failed. "Rachel was the outcast of the wedding," says one guest. "Everyone was talking about how she was the reason Jay didn't show." Plus, adds an insider, the groom "was hurt that Jay canceled." But another source says Mr. and Mrs. Carter sent their love - and "an amazing gift!" Also responding non to the bash: Vogue's Anna Wintour, who featured the couple on her April cover. A rep says the editor "had a long-standing family commitment."

### Why Did Rob Flee?

Not even devotion to his dan could keep the sock designer in Paris. After landing in the City of Light May 20, a 50-pounds-heavier Rob Kardashian suffered a bout of self-consdousness. He spent four days in France shrouded in jogging suits, then booked a last-minute flight home to LA., reportedly in tears. Explains a source, "He had a fit of depression. He just couldn't handle it." For her part, Kim was the last to learn of her brother's departure. Says a friend, "She was upset, but at that point, there was nothing she could do."

### What the Heck Was Jaden Smith Wearing?

White was appropriate for this wedding - Ermanno Scervino outfitted Kris, 58, and bridesmaids Kourtney, 35, and Khloé Kardashian, 29, and Kendall, 18, and Kylie Jenner, 16, in the shade. But Kylie's on-off boyfriend (invited along with his parents, Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, who sent their regrets) opted for a white suit - complete with superhero mask and cape! Also wearing a cape (red, Chanel): Vogue contributor André Leon Talley. That, however, was not a costume.

Which Pair Had a Fling?

Every wedding has a hookup, but this one was truly magical. A guest says Kim's friend Brittny Gastineau spent Friday night with illusionist David Blaine after he performed tricks at Versailles. Then, a second witness spotted the Eye on Glam blogger, 31, and the 41-year-old card whiz kissing while leaving their Florence hotel the morning after the nuptials. Says a source, "They were inseparable!"

Who Left the Fete First?

Grandma Kris was tasked with taking North (in Givenchy, like Mom and Dad!) back to her suite after the first dance. A source says the party raged on - courtesy of DJ-spun hits by Janet Jackson, Journey and, of course, West -past 2 a.m.!

The 'I Do' Details

The $410,000 fee for Forte di Belvedere - booked two months ago by celeb wedding guru Sharon Sacks - was a drop in the gold-plated bucket of the $12 million budget. The big-bucks breakdown:

The decor Thousands of candles ran the length of the $478,000 230-foot Calacatta Vaticano marble table - so big, it was hoisted into the venue in 22 pieces via crane. "It was like the table from The Last Supper," its designer, Gualtiero Vannelli, tells Us. West also commissioned artist Vanessa Beecroft to create 15 nude statues from the same marble.

The garb Kim's bridal finery had its own room at the five-star Villa San Michele. As stiletto designer Giuseppe Zanotti tells Us, "It was filled with clothes and shoes!" After wearing a $500,000 Givenchy for the vows, she slipped into a $40,000 Balmain by Olivier Rousteing and pumps by Zanotti.

The eats Guests washed down monkfish and beef filet with $90-a-bottle 2006 San Filippo Brunello di Montalcino. And there was more than enough vanilla-and-berry cake. At 7 feet, the confection was 22 inches taller than the bride!

The tunes Using his own piano, John Legend performed his No. 1 single "All of Me" for the couple's first dance. A custom marble piano (only two exist in the world!) was on hand for Bocelli earlier.

### Before the Wedding

Kim and West's prenuptial fetes were just as grand as the main event

### Bacheorette Party

Girls' night in the City of Light! Kim and about 20 pals, including La La Anthony and sisters Khloé, Kendall and Kylie, celebrated May 22 with dinner at Hôtel Costes. (They chose "light dishes," a source says.) Then, the bride-to-be - clad in a $20,000 Balmain dress inspired by a Fabergé egg - and her group piled into a party van for a tour of the Louvre and Eiffel Tower. An onlooker tells Us, "Kim looked relaxed and happy!"

### Brunch at Valentino's Estate

How about a chateau to go with that fortress and palace? On May 23, designer Valentino Garavani hosted a meal for the duo and their loved ones in his eight bedroom Château de Wideville. On the menu: artichoke salad and poached eggs, a source says. VIP guest North, who nibbled on vegetable tempura, was on her best behavior, said attendee André Leon Talley. The editor wrote on Vogue.com, "North cried not once nor grimaced."

### Rehearsal at Versailles

Don't rain on their palais. A fleet of black Mercedes and Range Rovers shuttled more than 100 guests out of the downpour for the black-tie rehearsal at the Château de Versailles on May 23. A source tells Us the couple, in his and hers Custom Maison Martin Margiela outfits, "had macarons, caviar, 1,000 bottles of champagne and the best wines" awaiting guests in the Hall of Mirrors. Later, Lan a Del Rey performed "Young and Beautiful," the pair's favorite song.
