summary: "For starters, Kanye West plays with the beat and uses lots of syncopated rhythms throughout the song; I wasn’t sure exactly where beat 1 was upon the first few listens, and frankly, I’m still not sure. But for our purposes, let’s say that the first sound you hear on the track is beat 1. Secondly, the song is in a minor key, with sparse instrumentation. Most hits today are in major keys and layered to the brim with sonic textures."

# Kanye West’s “Love Lockdown”

“Love Lockdown” is a unique brand of hit song. For starters, Kanye West plays with the beat and uses lots of syncopated rhythms throughout the song; I wasn’t sure exactly where beat 1 was upon the first few listens, and frankly, I’m still not sure. But for our purposes, let’s say that the first sound you hear on the track is beat 1. Secondly, the song is in a minor key, with sparse instrumentation. Most hits today are in major keys and layered to the brim with sonic textures. Perhaps Kanye took a cue from Prince, who hit big nearly 25 years ago with “When Doves Cry,” a famous example of a sparsely orchestrated hit in a minor key.

To learn the recurring piano part in “Love Lockdown,” I first recommend visiting Kanye’s blog at www.kanyeuniversecity.com/blog. Search on the site for “love lock down stems” and you’ll be able to hear and download each of the song’s individual tracks. This feature is meant for remixers, but it’s great for players, too! Download the piano tracks, and you’ll hear exactly what’s going on without having to listen around the vocals or drum tracks. kJ
