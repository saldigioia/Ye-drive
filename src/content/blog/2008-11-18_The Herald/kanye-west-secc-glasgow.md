# Kanye West, Secc, Glasgow

IT WAS hard to tell whether Mr West was being tongue-in-cheek when he apologised to fans for ruining all their future gig-going by "jading your minds with greatness", but it's clear that he has put his heart and soul into his current Glow in the Dark tour. While he deserves a grade A for effort, and respect for taking his sciencefiction fanboy fantasies to a hip hop crowd, the show doesn't quite live up to the hype.

The evening's theme was reflected in the slick supporting performance of Brooklynite Santogold, whose futuristic dancehall set, complete with wacky costumes and thigh-busting butterfly moves, warmed up the crowd for West's arrival by crashlanding spaceship.

Those singing along to every number probably hadn't come to watch their idol "acting" with a computer screen or bursting out of the stomach of a comedy Godzilla, but the inclusion of such daft moments didn't hamper their enjoyment as he powered through hits from The College Dropout, Late Registration and Graduation.

The perfectionism that makes West such a tremendous producer and recording artist makes him something of a frustrating live performer. The most memorable aspect of his last Glasgow gig was when he messed up a song and started it again, and this time around he was midway through his final number when he decided to go for a second take.

He's clearly determined to prove himself as a live rapper, with strong diction and impressive stamina, and although this approach obscures the wit and wisdom of some of his rhymes, its the only option for epic numbers like Diamonds from Sierra Leone and the thundering Stronger, which went down a storm.
