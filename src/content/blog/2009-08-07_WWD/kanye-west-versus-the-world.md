# Kanye West Versus the World

Recent interactions with Kanye West have found him skittish around the media, and his attitude at Wednesday night’s Casio G-Shock party at Cipriani on Wall St. was no exception. The rapper avoided all press, staying true to his statement at last week’s dinner celebrating Hussein Chalayan , when he said, “I don’t do interviews anymore. With anyone. For the rest of my life.”

When introduced to a reporter, West visibly withdrew and ignored all questions, instead opted to tout the achievements of his current squeeze, Amber Rose . “She just did her first shoot for Ford,” he exclaimed proudly, gesturing toward a beaming Rose, who was dressed in a leather corset and leggings not dissimilar to the black bondage-style stage costume sported by West. The rapper didn’t offer any further comments. When he later took to the stage, 90 minutes behind schedule, West interrupted his set with a spontaneous, free-style rant against the press, with such lines as “I’m sorry I broke your arm/I meant to break your camera” and “I could kill a man/I am a man/Don’t forget I could kill a man” regarding his fury at the invasive nature of today’s media. As he stirred the audience into a frenzy, the bevy of invited reporters and photographers at the event (marketed by Casio as a press conference accompanied by a concert), were left to fidget uncomfortably with their press passes.
