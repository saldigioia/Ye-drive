# Ten Beat Commandments

## There Are Rules to This Production Shit. Roc-a-Fella’s Soul Brotha Kanye West Pens the Manual.

1. If you a producer-rapper, save the heat for yourself—l mean, you just a producer-rapper. You ain’t getting that heat from nobody else.

2. Don’t play your beats for up-and-coming producers. They ain’t finna buy shit so that, there, is useless.

3. Don’t send tracks to any- and everybody who asks. They’ll have your shit on Pro Tools ‘cause that don’t cost no cash, even though you signed a deal under the label.

4. Still take a few stacks under the table.

5. If you brand-new, it’s hard to get your name. I had to do a lot of ghost beats to get in the game.

6. But if you do get a chance to play beats in a rapper’s face... Don’t play no gangsta shit for Will Smith or dance beats for Face.

7. Don’t be starstruck and track your beats before you get your first half. ‘Cause that’s the perfect way to never get your first half.

8. Rule eight is just like rule No. 4080: Industry people are shady. Fuck all that negotiating they try to get you caught in. I tell them, “Look, I do the beat, my manager do the talking.”

9. Get a decent rapper to rap on what you got in the stove. ‘Cause I wouldn’t have made it this far if it wasn’t for Hov.

10. And when you get hot, don’t let them screw you on your beats. Tax them niggas, ‘cause ain’t no telling if they’ll love you next week,
