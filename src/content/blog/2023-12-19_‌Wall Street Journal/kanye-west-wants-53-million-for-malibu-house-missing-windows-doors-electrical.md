# Kanye West Wants $53 Million for Malibu House Missing Windows, Doors, Electrical

## The Rapper Started a Gut Renovation of the Tadao Ando-Designed Oceanfront House Soon After Buying It for $57.25 Million in 2021

Rapper and designer Kanye West is listing a Tadao Ando-designed house in Malibu, Calif., for $53 million, two years after buying it for $57.25 million.

The musician, now known as Ye, bought the beachfront property in 2021 and began a gut renovation that he did not complete. “It will take several million dollars for the house to be finished,” said listing agent Jason Oppenheim of the Oppenheim Group, who said the roughly 4,000-square-foot house needs windows and doors, along with plumbing, electrical, HVAC and interior finishes.

Representatives for West didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The house was built in 2013 by Wall Street heavyweight Richard Sachs, who spent seven years on planning, permitting and construction, before listing the finished house for $75 million in 2020. Constructed out of Ando’s trademark smooth concrete, the house is made out of approximately 1,200 tons of concrete, 200 tons of steel and 12 pylons driven more than 60 feet into the sand, Oppenheim said. The three-story house has four bedrooms and giant window openings facing the water. There is another roughly 1,500 square feet of deck space.

Oppenheim said in its current condition, the house is a blank canvas. But he said, “Much of the architectural integrity and the architectural value of the house exists.” At this point, he added, the original finishes, which were removed, would have been somewhat dated. He declined to say why West is looking to sell.

In September, West was sued by a contractor who worked on the Malibu mansion and was also a live-in caretaker. The contractor alleged he was forced to work 16 hours a day and sleep on the floor near open insulation, according to court documents. The contractor claimed he was fired when he refused to rip out the home’s electrical system and replace the wiring with large generators, which he felt would be a fire hazard. West denied the allegations.

West has been rebuked for making antisemitic comments, losing partnerships last year with major brands including Adidas and Gap. His new album “Vultures” is set to be released this month.

Malibu’s median home sale price was $3.5 million in November, down 21.3% compared with November 2022, according to Redfin. But Oppenheim said the market is still relatively strong.

“It’s a stretch to make a claim that anywhere is doing as well as 2021 and 2022, but Malibu has held up significantly better than the city of Los Angeles,” where the mansion tax has impacted sales, he said.

Earlier this year, Beyoncé and Jay-Z paid about $200 million for an oceanfront Ando-designed mansion in Malibu.
