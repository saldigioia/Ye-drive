# Kanye West, John Legend, and Common

Kanye West likes to multitask: He called Fashion Backs from the treadmill, mid-conversation with a fellow gym bunny. “I’m getting myself together for the summer,” he told her, panting. Then he got on the phone: “Sorry, that was Nia Long,” These days, West isn’t just getting sweaty near the actresses he idolizes he’s also working with artists who inspired him growing up, such as rapper Common, whose new album, Finding Forever, will be released on West’s GOOD Music label, which also boasts pop-soul star John Legend. After making so many hits, West could afford more leisure time, so why doesn’t he slow down? “As sure as my public statements are,” he says, “I’m scared of not being the best, so I work 20 limes harder than everybody. I’m afraid of not being number one.”
