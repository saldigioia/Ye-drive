# Kanye West's Show Has Hall Hip-Hoppin'

Last year, uber-producer-turned-rapper Kanye West captured the ears of millions of young adults with his that-sounds-just-like-my-life debut album, “College Dropout.” Earlier this fall, he caught the wrath of those young adults’ parents when he infamously declared that “President Bush does not care about black people” during a Hurricane Katrina relief telethon.

That might have been the best marketing strategy of all. Just in time for the 2005-06 school year, West released — a week late, naturally — his sophomore album “Late Registration” to critical acclaim and financial success. At the moment, Kanye West is among the hottest names in pop music.

West’s tendency to rap about decidedly middle-class woes — working at the Gap, distrust in higher education, the importance of prenuptial agreements — has separated him from more commercially calculated gangsta rap acts like 50 Cent, the Game or Young Jeezy, landing his music under the headier classification of hip-hop. It has also granted him a thriving Caucasian fan base. So much so that on Wednesday night, West had to reassure white folks in the crowd that it was OK to sing along to the hook of his No. 1 hit “Gold Digger” — racial epithet and all.

The packed house was cleanly dressed, overwhelmingly young and, I should add, the best-smelling crowd I’ve ever been to concert with. Perfume, cologne, after-shave and flowery shampoo set a certain sensory tone as classy as West’s image. When he hit the stage, all of that good-smelling deodorant was put to the test as the grandstands erupted into dance.

West’s stage show is as ambitious and theatrical as his albums. A flowing, transitioning spectacle of sounds, images, sketches and live performance, it was definitely more technically involved than the thrown-together hip-hop tours I’ve seen in recent years. Nelly, I’m thinking about you here.

To the left of the stage, two backup singers covered the various vocal samples from Kanye’s albums. Behind them, on a dais with translucent front walls, sat a percussion player, a string septet, a keyboard player and DJ 8-Track; their images diffused in soft colors reminiscent of the orchestra in Disney’s “Fantasia.” Three digital projectors kept all of the blank spaces onstage occupied with color and image.

DJ A-Trak kept the show popping through the night, spinning fluid aural montages between songs that included works from Jay-Z, Twista, A-Ha and Phil Collins. The string accompaniment was especially effective; West’s love of mixing soulful samples with orchestral arrangements would not have sounded as lively if it were culled from prerecorded audio.

West, hip-hop’s most likely metrosexual this side of Usher, went through five wardrobe changes during his 90-minute show, each showcasing his love of preppy fashions — blazers, polos and even a cardigan — and briefly wore an orange and blue Illinois T-shirt during “Heard ‘Em Say.”

He seemed to be at ease in front of the crowd, playing emcee with a natural gravitation toward theatrics that included serenading an empty hospital bed during “Roses,” getting dressed for work in a mock bedroom before “Drive Slow” or dramatically collapsing over a bench at the end of “Bring Me Down” — a song aimed at West’s detractors.

Given that he has only two albums under his belt, West ran through a significant amount of his material during the show. “We Don’t Dare,” “Slow Jamz,” “Workout Plan” and “All Falls Down” were among the tracks played off “College Dropout,” while a larger portion of the show was dedicated to “Late Registration” material. Most notably from that album, “Hey Mama,” “Touch the Sky,” “We Major” and “Diamonds from Sierra Leone,” the latter of which closed out the show with the help of a massive, spinning disco ball.

The show was vibrant, fluid and, by all accounts, a top-notch production.

Which is not to say that it was perfect; occasionally the show collapsed under its own weight and complexity, threatening to throw the dancing grandstands off-step.

And West, a purported egotist, proved that although he is multitalented, there is one thing he is definitely not: a singer. During the hook of “Spaceship,” West’s unprofessional, tuneless vocals nearly strangled the otherwise building momentum of the show.
