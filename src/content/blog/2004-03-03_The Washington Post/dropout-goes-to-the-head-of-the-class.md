# ‘Dropout' Goes to the Head of the Class

Hip-hop fans are gobbling up Kanye West's ambitious CD "The College Dropout," largely because of two ubiquitous singles: "Through the Wire," an account of the auto accident that left the producer/rapper's jaw wired shut, and "Slow Jamz," a consciously gooey homage to lite-soul singers. FM stations of all stripes probably won't tire of them until the summer is over.

But both of West's hits are novelty tracks, in a sense -- they're based on ideas that could work only once, and they're also positioned as antidotes to hip-hop radio's chronic case of egotism. West likes himself, sure, but he doesn't sound quite like a superstar yet. It's a good thing.

Like any unrefined resume, the rest of "The College Dropout" probably should've been much shorter, but its ambition pays dividends. West's easygoing personal poetry holds up against the lyrical offerings of guests Jay-Z, Ludacris, Common and Talib Kweli. As a producer, West has made his name by building quirky R&B-based beats for such rappers. As an MC, he also sticks to a basic theme: There is more than one way to effectively navigate young adulthood.

For West, finding his way meant forgoing higher education while also realizing that a job in clothing retail would bring nothing but frustration: "Take me to the back and pat me, askin' me 'bout some khakis /But let some black people walk in, I bet you they show off their token blackie," he raps on "Spaceship." In other songs, he spends much time trying to define the middle ground between hip- hop's money-drugs-women lifestyle and the expectations of "normal" society.

Despite all those thoughtful verbals, West's grooves are the reason to hang around through all the guest appearances and sardonic anti-college skits. He returns often to his signature production gimmick -- speeding up vocals from vintage songs to the point where they lose most of their familiarity -- but a lot of the soul on "The College Dropout" comes from within. The bass lines are melodic, the choruses are musical, and West shows a balance between patience and imagination.

Examples of that approach are everywhere: The groove for "Breathe In Breathe Out" sounds as if West has a Stax/Volt horn section on a toggle switch; the jam-packed "We Don't Care" is equal parts head trip and street beat; and the stomping, piano-based rhythm of "School Spirit" is as good as anything Prince Paul created in his heyday with De La Soul.

West's rapping and producing skill-sets coalesce the best on "Jesus Walks," where he sticks up for his spirituality while backing himself with a dramatic, nearly militant sample from a hymn by the Arc Choir. Lyrics such as "I ain't here to argue about his facial features /Or here to convert atheists into believers" put West in a class by himself. He's no preacher, no professional sinner and no trained intellectual -- he's just a guy who figured out how to comfort himself in a world where it can be tough to make ends meet.
