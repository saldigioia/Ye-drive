# College Dropout

With Jay-Z’s recent retirement, Kanye West is shaping up to be the next big thing from the Roc-a-Fella camp. The Chicago native has crafted a debut set that will have fans and critics talking about more than just his hit-making tracks. Lead single “Through the Wire” samples Chaka Khan’s “Through the Fire” and chronicles West’s recovery after a near-fatal car accident: He shares an intimate look at what he went through following the incident with sharp yet witty lyrics. West takes a social stance on “All Falls Down.” The track, which features Syleena Johnson, educates and entertains. The album also includes an alternative version of Twista’s “Slow Jamz” (featuring West and Jamie Foxx). Despite the presence of all-star friends (Jay-Z, Talib Kweli, Common), West never loses control of his own, very solid set.
