# Kanye West Directs Surreal Digital Film “Runaway”

If R. Kelly’s “Trapped in the Closet” is a “hip-hopera,” then Kanye West’s “Runaway” is a Greek rap tragedy. West collaborated with screenwriter Hype Williams, production designer Vanessa Beecroft and cinematographer KyIe Kibbe to create an experience to rival the most ambitious videos, at least in terms of scope. It works as a standalone short film-a 34-minute one-and as a compilation of music videos that together tell the story of the ill-fated relationship between West and a phoenix-like creature (model Selita Ebanks) who crash-lands on Earth.

“Runaway” was shot over the course of four days and nights in and around the Czech capital of Prague: in the city, in forests, and in stripped-down industrial hangars. Each scene has a different look, so it made sense to shoot some of them with different cameras.

“I had the opportunity to use the [ARRI] Alexa, but the camera was still in the beta phase,” he recalls. “Ours was stuck at 24fps. It’s a good thing we had the [Vision Research] Phantom HD for the high-speed HD work.” The main camera was updated just in time to allow SxS recording at 1920x1080 with ProRes 4:2:2 compression.

Kibbe used a set of Zeiss Master Prime lenses with both cameras, shooting a lot of scenes wide open. “It looked great,” says Kibbe. “We were able to shoot a lot of scenes at night with available light.”

Back in New York, Nice Shoes colorisi Ron Sudul bled the evening skies a deep red, while Company 3 NY handled more than 100 effects shots, from simple composites and rig removals to bringing Ebanks, dressed in wings and feathers, out of explosion elements.

As a cinematographer who shoots commercials primarily (and the occasional documentary), Kibbe feels fortunate to work with créatives like West and Beecroft. “Kanye seems like he’s in a position in the industry where he can bend the music video genre and has the freedom to change the form,” muses Kibbe. “I think that’s exactly what he’s going to do.”
