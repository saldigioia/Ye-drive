# West Going Grammy Crazy

Kanye West couldn't even wait for the Grammy nominations to come out on Thursday before shooting his mouth off.

"If I don't win album of the year, I'm gonna really have a problem with that," the Chicago rapper told MTV this week, responding to predictions that his mouth would cost him a victory.

"I don't care if I jumped up and down right now on the couch like Tom Cruise. . . . I don't care how much I stunt--you can never take away from the amount of work I put into it."

And Kanye wasn't done: "I said I was the face of the Grammys last year. I'm 10 times that [this year]. . . . Two things: Do not let me get on that stage and do not let me get on that stage. Either way, we going crazy!"
