# A Happy End to a Hellish Pregnancy

## Kardashian and West Welcome Their Daughter Five Weeks Ahead of Schedule

Kim Kardashian and Kanye West burst through the doors of LA.’s Cedars-Sinai hospital late on June 14, desperate for help. She had been out for dinner at the Beverry Hills Hotel with her mom, Kris Jenner, waiting for the arrival of West’s flight from Switzerland. She began to feel pain, says a family insider, and as it worsened, her doctor told her to grab West and get to the hospital stat. It had been a stressful week in an already tough pregnancy, with the mom-to-be, five weeks from her July due date, recently ordered to go on bed rest for six hours a day. Now, the two faced an emergency situation.

“The doctors told them the baby was in distress, and Kim’s blood pressure was skyrocketing,” says thé insider. To save the baby girl, the doctors had to deliver her that night. “Kim was scared,” says the insider. “And the doctors had to assure her that even though the baby was early, she was ready.” West skipped a star-studded listening session for his new album Yeezus so that he could be by her side as she prepped for a natural delivery. “Kanye was more nervous than Kim and asked a lot of questions as he paced,” says a hospital source. “I have a feeling it was her telling him to breathe, not the other way around!” And when the newborn princess let out her first cry, says a person present at the delivery, “Kanye’s heart melted.” The unthinkable happened, adds the source: “He was speechless for a good five minutes!”

Welcome to the world, little West. (At presstime, the pair were still debating names, with North and Winter strong contenders.) Weighing in at just under 5 pounds, the preterm cutie is a mini-me of Mom. “She’s tiny and perfect,” says the family insider. “She looks just like Kim — with her dark hair and some of her features.” New aunt Khloé spoke for the Kardashian clan via Twitter on Father’s Day: “Mommy/baby are healthy & resting.” It’s a rest Kim, 32, has earned after a pregnancy she described as “just really painful everywhere.”

Indeed, at times it seemed Kim couldn’t catch a break. Her estranged husband Kris Humphries dragged her into court in April just to torture her as she started a new life with West. If that wasn’t enough, there was the Greek chorus of fat-shaming tabloids with headlines screaming dumped at 200 lbs and I CAN’T STOP EATING! All the while, Kim held her head up high while West, 36, often camped out in Paris, racing to finish his album. But family has changed everything. “Kanye has been amazing the last few days,” the insider says. “Everyone — including Kim — was worried about how he was going to step up, but it seems the feeling of being a little family has gotten to him. They’re both totally in love with this baby.”

First Days

To prove his devotion, West moved into the hospital to spend every minute with Kim. (They won’t leave until the baby’s weight reaches 5 pounds.) “Kanye has so much love for his daughter. He is so doting and has held her since the second she was born,” says a source close to Kim. “I don’t think he has slept a wink. He just wants to keep checking on Kim and the baby.” The rapper might have had an album dropping June 18, adds the source, but “all he wants is to be there for Kim now.”

And if he forgets, he has a boss to remind him: Kim. “For the next two weeks,” says the insider, “Kim wants him around 24/7”

The new parents have been showered with well wishes from family friends such as Beyoncé, Jay-Z and John Legend, says a source. Beyoncé even took to her website June 17, posting a gorgeous shot of the couple and urging them to “enjoy this beautiful moment together.” And everyone wants to get a look at the little one, who the proud new mom has gushed to a friend “is so cute and sweet!” Kim’s mom and her BFF Jonathan Cheban came to visit her on Father’s Day morning lugging a huge Louis Vuitton shopping bag. Longtime pal Brittny Gastineau was among the first to stop by Kim’s room, where it’s hard to find space amid the flowers. “She has over 30 bouquets from loved ones,” says the insider. “She told everyone not to bring sweets — she said she doesn’t need any temptations!”

Home at Last

While nesting at the hospital, Kim quickly finalized plans to take her family straight to Grandma Kris’ six-bedroom Hidden Hills, California, mansion. The new trio will live under Jenner’s protective wing while they renovate their own palace in L.A.’s Bel Air. Those work plans won’t be completed until December, but the family insider says it’s unlikely they’ll stay with Jenner the whole time. “They are looking at rentals.” (Point of fact, before the labor drama, the couple checked out a 10,000-square-foot home, conveniently fully furnished and ready to accommodate their $3,950 Lucite crib from Nurseryworks.)

Still, Jenner is so determined to show her support that she is — gasp! — converting her Louis Vuittonthemed version of a craft room into a spare bedroom for Kim’s new baby nurse. The caretaker also assisted Aunt Kourtney with the new baby’s cousin Penelope, 11 months. “Kim and Kanye are going to use the baby nurse for a year,” says a Kardashian source. “Shell wear a custom-made black-and-white uniform.”

The couple will need the help with their preemie. “Kim is a bit freaked out about everything,” says the family insider. “But the baby’s breathing and everything is fine.” Once she’s cleared to go home, their child shouldn’t encounter any lingering effects from the early birth. “These late preterms are probably a large chunk of preterm babies we see,” Dr. Lamia Soghier, medical director of the neonatology unit at the Children’s National Medical Center in Washington, DC, tells Us. “We like those kids because they tend to do well.” But Kim also needs to look after herself. New York-based Ob-Gyn Dorene Marínese tells Us the star should especially keep an eye on her hypertension “After discharge she should follow up with blood pressure checks. The condition can cause problems after the birth.”

A Bright Future

Try telling Kim she deserves a rest. Besides her moratorium on sweets, Kim is putting pressure on herself to get back the body she has so desperately missed. “She’s already looking ahead to when she can exercise again,” the family insider says of the 5-foot-2 beauty. Her goal weight is her old 115 pounds, but she was already stunning in a bikini prebaby on June 10 (see photo, page 49). To prepare for the snapback, Kim exercised throughout her pregnancy, focusing on a light-weight resistance program designed with the help of celeb trainer Tracy Anderson. A source says Kim is also interested in working out with Gunnar Peterson, who has helped sister Khloé drop 25 pounds. “She really wants to get back into shape,” says the family insider. “It’s important to her.” (Kim has said she plans to breast-feed for the first month, says a source, but she is taking a wait-and-see approach.)

While Mom may be getting camera ready, as of presstime she had told friends that she “100 percent wouldn’t sell photos of the baby,” says a pal. She has also told Us she has no desire to show her baby on reality television. A source at her E! network says there is talk of a secret recording leading up to the delivery, but the actual birth was kept private. “I believe they did film some with a home camcorder,” says the network source, “but it’s up to Kim if she ever wants anyone to see it.”

Determining her infant’s screen time as she tries to keep up with the Kardashians on TV might be one of Kim’s biggest decisions as a mom — but a family source says she can trust her instincts. Says the family source, “She’s going to be a great mother.” Besides, after all she’s been through during her pregnancy, she’s proven she can handle anything.
